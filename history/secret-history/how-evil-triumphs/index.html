    <h1>How Evil Triumphs?</h1>
    This perspective is offered for thought and discussion, not as absolute truth.

    <h3 style="margin: 20px 0 4px;">The Idea of Ritual Sacrifice</h3>
    Historically, acts of extreme violence, such as human sacrifice, have been observed across various cultures like the Aztecs, Phoenicians (who practiced child sacrifice), and Romans. It is theorized that such acts, <b>when performed publicly, can serve a purpose beyond mere violence</b>. They might be used to unite a group by forcing a shared, undeniable taboo. By creating a situation where the group is widely condemned, it could galvanize internal cohesion and commitment, aligning with certain extreme beliefs or prophecies. <br>
    These ancient practices of ritual sacrifice are linked to current events of Gaza. the public nature of the events in Gaza is intentional, designed to unite the Israeli population by creating a shared taboo and angering the world, aligning with an extreme form of Jewish eschatology.<br><br><br><br><br>


    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 4px;">Thought Experiment: Monkey Island</h3>
    Imagine a scenario where a group of individuals is placed in a desperate situation, like being stranded on an island with dangerous creatures flesh-eating monkeys. To survive, they would instinctively form a tight-knit community. This involves developing a common language, creating a shared story or "founding myth" about their purpose, and establishing rituals that foster deep intimacy and bonding. A crucial aspect of this bonding is the emergence of a leader willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the group, inspiring extreme loyalty and dedication.<br><br>
    This process cultivates intense cohesion and synchronicity, creating a "<b>hive mind</b>" where individuals act as one, even sacrificing themselves without hesitation for the collective, as seen in examples like jumping on a grenade. It is theorized that groups forged in such extreme unity could, upon returning to a larger society, secretly gain and maintain significant power, passing this legacy to their descendants.<br><br><br><br><br>


    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 4px;">Historical Examples of Cohesion</h3>
    This concept of forging extreme unity through hardship is reflected in historical military societies:
    <ul style="margin: 8px 0 4px">
      <li><b>The Spartans</b> subjected young boys to a brutal education system involving hazing, same-sex mentorship, and even secret killings of slaves (Helots) as a rite of passage. These practices, though disturbing, are thought to have cultivated unparalleled solidarity and military dominance.</li>
      <li><b>The Sacred Band of Thebes</b>, an elite unit of 300 soldier-lovers, also demonstrated how deep personal bonds could translate into formidable military prowess.</li>
      <li><b>Macedonia's army</b> under Philip II and Alexander the Great similarly adopted and adapted these methods to build their strength.</li>
    </ul><br><br><br><br>


    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 4px">The Strategy of Transgression</h3>
    From the point of view of game theory, in the "game" of winning against a million competitors, the best strategy is cheating (breaking the rules). While working together provides a huge advantage, if coordination is obvious, it forces an "arms race of coordination." To win decisively, groups must "conspire secretly" and coordinate without detection. While obvious factors like race, religion, or family facilitate coordination, they are too easily copied.<br><br>

    The unique strategy that allows for secret coordination and defeat of all enemies is transgression—the breaking of taboos, social norms, or social laws. The fundamental theory proposed is that 

    <div align="center" style="line-height: 1.17;"><b><i>
      the greater the level of transgression,<br>
      the greater the resulting cohesion,<br>
      which inevitably leads to synchronicity.
    </i></b></div><br><br>
    <ul style="margin: 0 0 4px">
      <li><b>Mechanism of Cohesion</b>: Transgression forces cohesion because when a group breaks a serious law, they must keep the secret to survive and avoid imprisonment. If anyone betrays the group, they are all punished, thus unifying them.</li>
      <li><b>Psychological Effects</b>: Transgression is experienced as empowering and liberating, and it becomes addictive. The group feels more powerful than their authorities, motivating them to break more rules.</li>
      <li><b>The Ultimate Taboos</b>: The addiction culminates in the ultimate taboos: human sacrifice and incest. These acts are performed because they are believed to release "divine energy" and grant access to ultimate power or God, while simultaneously generating the ultimate cohesion and synchronicity necessary for global control.</li>
    </ul><br>
    The conclusion is that these secret societies are in control because their use of transgression allows them to be uniquely motivated, secretive, and synchronized.<br><br>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2 style="margin: 0 0 4px">A Philosophical Lens on Power and Evil</h2>
    To understand the deeper rationale behind these theories, philosophical concepts can be applied:

    <ul>
    <li>Kant's distinction between the "phenomena" (the world as we perceive it through our minds' filters) and the "noumena" (objective reality beyond our perception) suggests that our reality is constructed by our brains.</li>
    <li>Hegel expands on this, proposing that the "noumena" is the "geist" (spirit), a universal, expanding spiritual force that shapes our perceptions and connects our minds.</li>
    <li>Plato and Gnostic traditions introduce the "monad" (or "nous"), a supreme, divine source of all existence, from which all reality emanates. The purpose of life, in this view, is to return to this monad. Plato believed this return was achieved through the pursuit of knowledge.</li>
    <li>Dante offered an alternative path: the monad is ultimately love, and returning to it involves the pursuit of unconditional love for others. Dante posited that the monad grants free will, even if it leads to evil, and sends messengers to guide humanity.</li>
    </ul>

    Within this framework, evil is understood as the denial of the spiritual world and an excessive focus on the material world. The powerful groups, in this theory, maintain their control by denying the true nature of the monad and promoting a materialistic view of reality. Transgression, in this context, allows these groups to align with specific, perhaps lower, spiritual forces within this multi-dimensional universe, thereby gaining their synchronized power.
