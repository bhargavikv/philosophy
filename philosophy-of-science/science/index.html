    <h1>Science</h1>
    Science (from Latin <i>scientia</i> 'knowledge') is a systematic enterprise <b>that builds and organizes knowledge 
    in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe</b>. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their 
    contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and <b>shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical 
    antiquity</b>, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on 
    natural causes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated 
    in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but was preserved in the Muslim world 
    during the Islamic Golden Age. The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe 
    from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural philosophy", which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution
    <a href="#m1" id="w1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from 
    previous Greek conceptions and traditions. The scientific method<a href="#m2" id="w2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> soon played 
    a greater role in knowledge creation.

    <h3>BRANCHES OF SCIENCE</h3>
    Modern science is typically divided into three major branches.
    <ul>
        <li><b>the natural sciences</b> - which study nature in the broadest sense<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        e.g. biology, chemistry and physics</li>
        <li><b>the social sciences</b> -  which study individuals and societies<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        e.g. economics, psychology, and sociology</li>
        <li><b>the formal sciences</b> - which deal with symbols governed by rules<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        e.g. logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science</li>
    </ul>
    Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are 
    described as <b>applied sciences</b>.

    <h3> Meanings and Notes </h3>
    <a id="m1" href="#w1">scientific revolution</a> - It was a series of events that marked the emergence of modern 
    science during the early modern period, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human 
    anatomy) and chemistry transformed the views of society about nature. The Scientific Revolution took 
    place in Europe towards the end of the Renaissance period and continued through the late 18th century, <br>
