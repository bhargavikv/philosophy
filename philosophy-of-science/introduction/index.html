    <h1>Philosophy of Science</h1>
    The relation between the sciences – physical, biological, social and behavioral – and 
    philosophy are so close that philosophy of science must be a central concern of both 
    philosophers and scientists.
    <br>
    On this definition, philosophy deals with
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>the questions which the sciences cannot yet or perhaps can never answer and</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>the further questions of why the sciences cannot answer these questions.</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    Whether there are any such initial questions is itself a matter that can only be settled 
    by philosophical argument. Moreover, if there are none, how science should proceed in its 
    attempts to answer its as-yet unanswered questions is also a matter for philosophical 
    debate. This makes philosophy unavoidable for scientists. A cursory study of the history 
    of science from the Greeks through Newton and Darwin to the present century reveals these 
    (as yet) scientifically unanswered questions.

    <h3>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY</h3>
    Science as we recognize it seems to have begun with the ancient Greeks. <br><br>

    <br>
    Thus, by the 3<sup>rd</sup> century BC, Euclid’s work had made <b>geometry</b> a “science 
    of space” separate from but still taught by philosophers in Plato’s Academy. Galileo, 
    Kepler and finally Newton’s revolution in the 17<sup>th</sup> century made <b>physics a 
    subject separate from metaphysics</b>. To this day, the name of some departments in which 
    physics is studied is “natural philosophy”. In 1859 The <i>Origin of Species</i> set 
    <b>biology</b> apart from philosophy (and theology) and at the turn of the twentieth 
    century, <b>psychology</b> broke free from philosophy as a separate discipline. In the 
    past fifty years, philosophy’s millennium-long concern with logic has given rise to 
    <b>computer science</b>. But each of these disciplines, which have spun off from 
    philosophy, have left to philosophy a set of distinctive problems: issues they cannot 
    resolve, but must leave either permanently or at least temporarily for philosophy to 
    deal with. Some examples are <br><br>
  
    <b> Q1) Math: What is a number ?</b> (not as a symbol but as a thing) <br>
    Philosophers have been offering different answers to this question at least 
    since Plato held that numbers were things – albeit, abstract things. By contrast with Plato, 
    other philosophers have held that mathematical truths are not about abstract entities
    and relations between them, but are made true by facts about concrete things in the 
    universe, and reflect the uses to which we put mathematical expressions. <br><br>
    <b> Q2) Physics: What are space and time ?</b> (not in their units of measurement like hrs, metres etc..) <br>
    Explaining exactly what “time” means is a problem which science has left to philosophy 
    for a period of at least 300 years. With the advent of the special and general theory 
    of relativity physicists began to take a share in trying to answer this question again. 
    Albert Einstein’s own reflections on time, which led to the conclusion that time intervals 
    – durations – differ among different reference frames – points from which they are measured,
    owe much to the philosopher Leibniz’s critique of Newton’s conception of 
    <blockquote><b>
    space and time as independent containers in which things can be absolutely located and 
    dated.
    </b></blockquote>
    <br><br>

    <b>Q3) Biology: What is the meaning of life (if exists) ?</b><br>
    Similarly, many biologists and not a few philosophers have held that after Darwin, 
    evolutionary biology took back from philosophy the problem of identifying the nature 
    of man or the purpose or meaning of life. And some biologists and philosophers hold 
    what Darwinism shows is that <b>man’s nature is only different by degrees from that of 
    other animals.</b> Moreover, these thinkers argue that the theory of natural 
    selection<a href="#m1" id="w1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> shows that there is no such thing 
    as a distinctive human nature nor any purpose and meaning to life. They argue that 
    Darwin’s great achievement was to show that 
    <blockquote><b>
    there is no such thing as purpose, goals, ends, meaning or 
    intelligibility<a href="#m2" id="w2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> in the universe, 
    that its appearance is just an “overlay<a href="#m3" id="w3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>” we 
    confer<a href="#m4" id="w4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> on the adaptations we 
    discern<a href="#m5" id="w5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> in nature, 
    adaptations that are really just the result of the environment’s persistent filtration of 
    blind variations creating the appearance of design.
    </b></blockquote>
    It is for this reason that evolutionary theory is so widely 
    resisted; some think it claims to answer questions which should be left to philosophy, 
    or perhaps even religion.<br><br>

    <b>Q4) Logic:</b><br>
    All of the sciences, and especially the quantitative ones, rely heavily on
    the reliability of logical reasoning and deductively valid arguments; the
    sciences also rely on inductive arguments – ones which move from finite
    bodies of data to general theories. But none of the sciences address directly
    the question of why arguments of the first kinds are always reliable, and why
    we should employ arguments of the second kind in spite of the fact that they
    are not always reliable. These are matters with which the subdiscipline of
    philosophy called logic broadly concerns itself.
    <br><br>

    <div align="center">
        <b><i>
            One of the oddities about philosophy is that it seems to be a heterogeneous
        </i></b>
    </div>
    <div align="center">
        <b><i>
            subject without the unity that characterizes, say, economics, or chemistry.
        </i></b>
    </div>
    <br>
    Among its subdisciplines, there is logic – the study of valid forms of reasoning,
    aesthetics – the study of the nature of beauty, ethics and political philosophy
    which concern themselves with the basis of moral value and justice, epistemology– the 
    study of the nature, extent and justification of knowledge, and metaphysics which 
    seeks to identify the fundamental kinds of things that really exist. <b>What brings 
    all these diverse questions together in one discipline</b>? Here is a working definition 
    of philosophy that identifies something these subdisciplines all have in common.
    Philosophy deals with two sets of questions: <br>
    <ol>
        <li>First, the questions that science – physical, biological, social, behavioral –
            cannot answer now and perhaps may never be able to answer</li>
        <li>Second, the questions about why the sciences cannot answer the first lot of
            questions.</li>
    </ol>
