    <h1>MODERN SCIENCE as PHILOSOPHY</h1>
    Besides the traditional questions which each of the sciences left as an intellectual
    legacy to philosophy, the development of the sciences over two millennia and more has 
    persistently raised new questions with which philosophers have struggled. Moreover, these 
    two millennia of scientific development have shaped and changed the agenda of 
    philosophical inquiry as well. <b>Science has surely been the most powerful source 
    of philosophical inspiration since its revolutionary successes of the seventeenth 
    century. </b><br>
    <h3>NEWTON'S DETERMINISTIC LAWS</h3>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Newton showed that motion – whether of planets and comets, or cannon balls and tides – was 
    <b>governed by a small number of simple, mathematically expressible and perfectly 
    exceptionless laws</b>. These laws were deterministic: given the position of the planets at 
    any one time at all, the physicist could calculate their position at any past time and any 
    future time. 
    <br><br>
    <div align="center">
        <b><i>
            If Newton is right, a body’s position and momentum at any one time

    </div>
    <div align="center">
        <b><i>
            fix position and momentum for all future times.
        </i></b>
    </div>
    <p>
    What is more, the same inexorable<a href="#m1" id="w1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> laws bind all 
    matter, anything with mass. The determinism of Newtonian mechanics raised the specter of 
    determinism in human behavior as well. For if humans are nothing but complex collections 
    of molecules, i.e. of matter, and if these collections behave in accordance with the 
    self-same laws, then <b>there is no real freedom of choice, there is only the illusion 
    of it</b>. Suppose we trace the causes of our apparently free actions, for which we are 
    responsible, back through their previous causes to our choices, our desires, and the 
    physical states of our brains in which these desires are represented. If the brain is
    nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical 
    laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and 
    determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long 
    row of them.
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If the causes which fixed the events in our brain include events over which 
    we have no control – say, our upbringing, our present sensory stimulation and physiological 
    states, our environment, our heredity – then it may be claimed that there is no scope in 
    this vast causal network for real free choice, for action (as opposed to mere behavior),
    and so <b>no room for moral responsibility</b>. What is determined by the prior state of 
    things and therefore beyond our control is not something for which we can be blamed, or 
    praised for that matter.
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    With the success of Newton’s theory, determinism became a live philosophical
    option. But it remained open to some philosophers and of course to
    many theologians to hold that physics does not bind human action, or for
    that matter the behavior of any living thing. They held that the realm of the
    biological was beyond the reach of Newtonian determinism. And the proof
    of this was the fact that <br>
    </p>
    <div align="center">
        <b><blockquote>
            physical science could not explain biological processes at all,
        </blockquote></b>
    </div>
    let alone with the power and precision that it explained the
    behavior of mere matter in motion.
    <h3>WHAT ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THEN ?</h3>
    <p>
    Until the middle of the nineteenth century, opponents of determinism
    might have comforted themselves with the thought that human action, and
    the behavior of living things generally, were exempt<a href="#m2" id="w2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
    from the writ of Newtonian
    laws of motion. <b>Human action and biological processes are evidently
    goal-directed, they happen for a purpose and reflect the existence of pedestrian
    ends which we strive to achieve and the vast scheme of things which
    God effortlessly attains</b>. The biological realm shows too much complexity,
    diversity and adaptation to be the product of mere matter in motion; its
    appearance of design shows the hand of God. Indeed, before Darwin, the
    diversity, complexity and adaptation of the biological realm were the <b>best
    theological<a href="#m3" id="w3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> argument for God’s existence and for 
    the existence of a “plan”</b> that gives the universe meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If Darwin’s evolutionary account of diversity, complexity and adaptation as the result 
    of heritable genetic variation and natural environmental selection is right, there is 
    no scope for a universe with meaning, purpose or intelligibility beyond the sort of 
    clock-work determinism which Newton achieves. And this is a profoundly philosophical 
    conclusion, which goes even beyond mere determinism by showing all purpose in
    nature to be illusory. Between them, Newton and Darwin are the great sources of 
    philosophical materialism<a href="#m4" id="w4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> or physicalism.
    </p>

    <h3>RISE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS</h3>
    <p>
    But, twentieth-century developments in physics and the foundations of
    mathematics have shaken the confidence of philosophical materialism far
    more than any merely philosophical arguments. First, the attempt to extend
    deterministic physical theory from observable phenomena to unobservable
    processes came up against the appearance of sub-atomic indeterminism in nature.
    It has turned out that <b>at the level of quantum processes</b> – the behavior
    of electrons, protons, neutrons, the photons of which light is composed, alpha,
    beta and gamma radiation – <b>there are no exceptionless laws, the laws seem
    to be ineliminably indeterministic.  We cannot know what is going on with 
    certainty and have to satisfy ourselves with mere probability</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At the fundamental level of nature, the principle of same cause, same effect, is
    invariably violated. Of course by the time electrons, protons and other particles get 
    lumped together into molecules, their behavior begins asymptotically to approach
    that of the determinism Newtonian mechanics demands.
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now, does all this mean that if determinism is false, free will and moral
    responsibility are after all vindicated<a href="#m5" id="w5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
     as acceptable components of our philosophical
    world-view? Things are not that simple. For <b>if the fundamental
    sub-atomic interactions that constitute our brain processes are not determined
    by anything at all</b>, as quantum physics tells us, then there is even less
    room for moral responsibility in our actions. For actions will then stem from
    events that have no causes themselves, no reason at all for their occurrence.
    </p>

    <h3>THEN WTF !!!</h3>
    <p>
    Mathematician, physicist and philosopher René Descartes's argument is that 
    <blockquote><b>
    the mind is distinct from the body or any part of the body, in particular the brain. 
    </b></blockquote>
    The mind is a separate and distinct substance, a non-physical one, and therefore not 
    subject to the laws which physical science can uncover. <b>If the mind is indeed not a 
    physical thing, this may exempt humans and human action from obeying the
    natural laws science uncovers</b> or even from scientific study itself. It may
    turn out that humans and human actions must be understood by methods
    completely different than those which characterize natural science. Or it
    may be that human affairs cannot be understood at all.
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Unlike computers, minds like ours can identify the inconsistent statement in one 
    axiom system program that is complete, and the one true statement which is unprovable
    in the closest alternative axiom system-program that is consistent. So, evidently
    we, or <b>our minds</b>, or at least the rules of thought we employ, <b>are not
    merely the software implemented on the hardware (or wetware) of our
    brains</b>. Since this mathematical result reflects a limitation on any physical
    system, no matter what material it is made from – silicon chips, vacuum
    tubes, cogs and wheels, or neurons and synapses – it is argued, by some distinguished
    physicists among others, the human mind cannot be material at
    all. And therefore, it is <b>not subject to study by means appropriate to the
    study of material objects</b>, whether those means are to be found in physics,
    chemistry or biology.
