        Put love at the centre of your life and not discipline!!!<br>
        By doing this, you will be a happier person. You will achieve what you want to achieve. What this means is that <b>"Discipline without love turns into punishment"</b>. You need love to be part of discipline. First and foremost, you need love at the center, at the center of all your decisions, at the center of how you approach everything. And then, discipline follows.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Starting a journey towards bettering yourself is an absolutely fantastic thing to do. But it should not come from a place of self-punishment or a place of fear. It should come from a place of love and nurture.

      There is a TED <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkeuKPZxEhM" target="_blank">Talk</a> by a <i>death doula</i> who noted that people at the end of their lives prioritize loved ones and connection over accomplishments or possessions. This highlights the ultimate importance of love. At the end of it all, love is the center of everything.<br><br><br><br>
      Are you approaching your goals with the mindset that if you fail, you are lazy, unmotivated, or stupid?<br>
      In the past, I told myself that skipping the gym made me lazy. Now, I choose a different perspective: I want to go to the gym because my body deserves to be cared for. It deserves to have attention paid to it. It deserves to move. It deserves to have strength.<br>
      The idea of the chemicals used to help a plant grow is is the same idea as coming from a point of view of fear of fear that you won't grow of kind of a forceful nature whereas whereas the help from the other plants is coming from the perspective of love and generosity.<br><br><br>
      It's great to have goals. And obviously in life we kind of sometimes need these tangible goals set up, but I think that

        This book (and its film adaptation, The Quiet Girl) demonstrates the transformative power of love. A neglected child's life changes dramatically when she experiences genuine care, highlighting how love helps individuals come out of their shell and see life differently.<br>
        She finally understands what it feels like to be loved!!!<br>
        <blockquote>
          Her hands are like my mother's hands, but there is something else in them, too.<br>
          Something I've never felt before and have no name for.<br>
          I feel at such a loss for words, but this is a new place and new words are needed.
