        Put love at the centre of your life and not discipline 💖<br>
        By doing this, you will be a happier person. You will achieve what you want to achieve. What this means is that <b>"Discipline without love turns into self-punishment"</b> 🛑 You need love to be part of discipline. First and foremost, you need love at the center, at the center of all your decisions, at the center of how you approach everything. And then, discipline follows 🕊️<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Starting a journey towards bettering yourself is an absolutely fantastic thing to do. But it should not come from a place of self-punishment or a place of fear. It should come from a place of love and nurture. Love just doesn't make the grind worth it, it make it bearable.<br>

      Are you approaching your goals with the mindset that if you fail, you are lazy, unmotivated, or stupid?<br>
      In the past, I told myself that skipping the gym made me lazy. Now, I choose a different perspective: I want to go to the gym because my body deserves to be cared for. It deserves to have attention paid to it. It deserves to move. It deserves to have strength. 💪 <b>Love gives purpose</b> to the pain that you're putting yourself through.<br>
      Like love says, <i>I'm not pushing myself because I hate where I am. I'm pushing because I love who I'm becoming 🌱</i><br><br>
      The idea of the chemicals used to help a plant grow is is the same idea as coming from a point of view of fear of fear that you won't grow of kind of a forceful nature whereas whereas the help from the other plants is coming from the perspective of love and generosity.

      It's great to have goals. And obviously in life we kind of sometimes need these tangible goals set up, but I think that

      Sometimes, i get my so in my head that life is about struggle and difficulty and STAY HARD, which is a good mentality to be in. It is good to be in because when you need a kick in the pants to get shit done, you need that place of endless fire and motivation to pull from. But then I spend an afternoon with my friends and I'm at peace. And nothing really matters as fiercely as it did. No goal of mine or accomplishing anything compares to the love I share with them. Love is and always will be the most important. If you want to go for things or accomplish things, that's second. But it should never get in the way of being with the things and the people you love.

    <div align="center"><b><i>You are meant to go out in the world and find what you love and do that forever!</i></b></div>

      That doesn't mean the path will be all sunshine and roses. It will suck.<br>But anything is worth being with what you love and to be doing what you love to do.

      There is a <b>talk by a <i>death doula</i></b> who works with hospice patients all the time and see people at the end of their life dying. And you know what they ask for at the end of their fucking life? At the end of their life, you want to know what they ask for?<br>
      They don't ask, "Oh, can I see my trophies one more time? Oh, can I go look at my certificates one more time? Can someone read me a list of accomplishments that I've done in this life?" They ask for the people that they love. They just want to be with them one last time. that the simple art of connecting with those they love is the last thing that anyone on this earth wants to do. This highlights the ultimate importance of love. At the end of it all, love is the center of everything.

        This book (and its film adaptation, The Quiet Girl) demonstrates the transformative power of love. A neglected child's life changes dramatically when she experiences genuine care, highlighting how love helps individuals come out of their shell and see life differently.<br>
        She finally understands what it feels like to be loved!!!<br>
        <blockquote><i>
          Her hands are like my mother's hands, but there is something else in them, too.<br>
          Something I've never felt before and have no name for.<br>
          I feel at such a loss for words, but this is a new place and new words are needed.
