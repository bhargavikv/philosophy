# Philosophy 


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophical knowledge always requires an in-depth analysis and reflection. We will discover the diversity of world perceptions that philosophy offers: from ancient times up to the 21st century. <b>Any philosophical discussion begins with defining what philosophy is</b>. Actually, this is the question every new generation of philosophers tackles. They attempt to identify the limits, boundaries, possibilities, and the object of philosophy.

### SCIENCE vs PHILOSOPHY
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, <b>any natural science - physics, chemistry, or biology - has an object of study</b>. Physics studies the laws of the universe, biology deals with living beings, and so on. So, sciences have an object they focus on. Turning to philosophy, <b>it is a field without an object of investigation. Rather, the object of philosophy is philosophy itself</b>. The key thing here is, philosophical knowledge is not exactly scientific, regardless of how harsh it might sound. I will try to give you a reasonable explanation of why there is a huge difference between science and philosophy. While the <b>former studies some natural phenomena, the latter concerns itself with the ways the knowledge about the world can be obtained</b>.

### MYTHOLOGY vs PHILOSOPHY
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth saying - it would be helpful to distinguish between philosophical worldview and mythological. <b>Myths were created to offer answers and give us a clear image of the world</b>. In many ways, they allow a clear understanding of the surrounding reality. This is why myths and mysticism are almost likely to remain in the human mind today and in the future. In 90% of cases, we, everyone, and even professional philosophers tend towards explaining things that happen in a mythological way. As for philosophical worldview, it problematizes the world around us and asks questions. True philosophy arises from a feeling of surprise and being surprised by simple things. In daily life, we do not ask questions about the nature and essence of objects around us. You and I live automatically most of the time, and that's all right. We do not bombard the world with questions but live according to certain rules. We are given the answers to how to act, what to aim at, and such a way of life involves mythological thinking. Unlike this, <b>philosophy lets us stop for a moment, ask questions, and problematize the world</b>.
</p>
  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the simple process of speaking, for example. It is of great interest, how we can cognize<a href="#m1" id="w1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> the meaning of words and speech, communicate and share thoughts. Though we cannot be sure, we mean the same by the same words. And that is the problem. In everyday life, we do not ask ourselves so many questions. We do not wonder about simple things and rarely reflect upon philosophical matters. 95% of the time, we live automatically and that ensures a normal course of life. But in the remaining 5%, we start to put questions and seek information about the world. This is where philosophy comes into the picture.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are going to talk about natural philosophy - Thales, Anaximander, Democritus, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Pythagoras, and others. We will see what they considered to be the foundation of the world, its primary essence. The philosophers of the 20th century - Roland Barthes, for example - show how mythological thinking works. The best means to protect oneself from becoming ideologically committed, from political manipulations is the ability to ask questions, to doubt the things no one doubts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, before plunging into the philosophy of ancient times, I would like to mention a significant point in the history of philosophy of the 20th century. Philosophy arises as a salvation of the human from despair. We lose our values and we lose connection to reality. An understandable world that we know crumbles. Philosophy arises on the ruins of the previous values of the world. It appears when we lose support - ideological and religious. We can no longer comprehend reality the way we used to. Heidegger said, that <b>"philosophy is the desire to be at home everywhere"</b>.
</p>
  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, let's take a step back here. In any culture<a href="#m2" id="w2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, a person has a worldview system. They cannot live in primordial<a href="#m3" id="w3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> chaos or perceive the world as it is. This is why <b>culture serves as a safety bag between us - feeling creatures - and the world. We cannot perceive the world directly. We have to define it somehow, to cognize it, and to tell a story about it</b>. Myth is a way of understanding it. When you say "there is Zeus on Olympus," this also implies a certain worldview; in this case, the world is no longer seen as unordered chaos, but a whole cosmos, a proportional cosmos. In a broad sense, this shows where culture takes roots. Culture is an interlayer between the feeling, thinking, and striving human and the world. The world always scares us in its primordial state. In the 20th century, the experience of reality was thought of as an experience of the terrible. Lacan, Badiou supported this idea. The stark reality is always terrifying. But we never face it within a culture. We perceive it through language, social norms, ethics, and morality. The experience of facing primordial reality is what German romanticists were striving to gain, what Nietzsche wrote about.

Science is another means to comprehend the surrounding world. We learn its physical laws and thus discover the way it works. Culture offers us several options of how to get the full knowledge of the world, several worldview systems. In many ways, they all have much in common. All of them are to protect you. By the way, Freud wrote about it in <i>The Future of an Illusion.</i> To conclude the introduction, I'd like to say that, unlike other sciences, philosophy serves as a tool for cognition and comprehension of the world around us, ourselves, and our place in it.
