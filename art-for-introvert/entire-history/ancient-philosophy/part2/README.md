# The Origins of Philosophy

Let's go to the roots of philosophy and follow its development from mythological thinking as well as clarify its main features.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered to have <b>originated in ancient Greece</b>, where before, mythological mode of thinking was dominant, as in any other culture of the era. <b>Mythology emerged as an initial way of comprehending the surrounding reality. Imagine humans leaving a cave and seeing the diversity of the world in front of them.</b> There is some ecumene, an inhabited space and the inhabitable world. So, the first humans start to give names to the objects and phenomena of nature they encounter, personify them, and create myths about them. Thereby, mythology marks the world and endows<a href="#m1" id="w1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> it with meanings. First of all, it provides an ancient person with firm basis for an all-encompassing<a href="#m2" id="w2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> worldview.
</p>

### MYTHOLOGICAL VIEWS
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking now at its foundations, <b>the principle of guilt and reward is worth mentioning. In mythology, whatever goes on obeys the law of cause-effect</b>. In other words, if you commit something immorally wrong and are guilty, consequently, you get what you deserve. The revenge inevitably<a href="#m3" id="w3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> comes after. Generally, the mythological worldview has still been present in our culture. We can find the echoes of it in our language and mentality even today. More simply, when something happens in your life, or you hit your pinky toe, you ask why you deserved it all. This is how your mythological thinking reveals itself. You try to find out for what actions in the past you have just been punished. Of course, that's an everyday example. When it comes to ancient legends, everything is on a bigger scale, for they tell about heroes killing each other: a father killing his son, a son killing his mother, and the like. I hope you now have an idea of how it all hangs together.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the mythological mindset, there is nothing outside the world. Even the underworld is a part of it. Cave art is a highlight of mythological thought, and it was created as a projection of reality. Drawings of buffalos were made on cave walls in an effort to influence real buffalos, and this way, it was a utilitarian ritual gesture. That means, by drawing a hunting scene a member of the tribe could help their hunters in reality. All these images were endowed with power. Now, imagine such a situation in your life: you print the photo of your beloved one and then someone comes to you and says, "Why don't we stab the photo with a knife?" As kids of the 21st century, maybe the late 20th-21st century, we perfectly understand that if we stab the photo, nothing will happen. It's just a photo. Yet, 90% of us will hesitate. Well, I would not feel comfortable stabbing a photo. Rationally, there is no reason for not stabbing the photo, but somehow, we feel that the image has a connection with a real person. This is why we do not want to ruin it. Even though rationally, we cannot explain why. Well, maybe because of these mythical traces in our consciousness.
</p>

### BIRTH OF PHILOSOPHY
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, a mythical worldview, like any other strong cultural paradigm, eventually faced a crisis. At some moment it stopped being able to explain the overall scheme of things. At this moment, another strong theory emerged and replaced the previous one. This is how philosophy was born in ancient times. The <b>reason for that crisis was that the mythological mindset started to contradict itself</b>. Even Homer's texts were controversial. If speaking of all other myths, I would like to say a few words about Antiquity<a href="#m4" id="w4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. There were more than a thousand poleis<a href="#m5" id="w5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> in antique world. It was incredibly fragmented. We sometimes think the ancient world comprised Athens, Sparta, and a couple of other poleis. Not exactly. There were thousands of them. <b>This disjointed<a href="#m6" id="w6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> world had hundreds of versions of the same myths</b>. In our culture, we have the feeling that Athena was a woman. Trust me, it has not always been like this. For Greeks, she was someone of both sexes. So, as one can conclude, the myth lost its explanatory power.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where philosophy took center stage and started to explore the world as working on the basis of cause-effect chains. The course of just a few centuries determined the mode of understanding the world for thousands of years. We find the origins of 90% of political regimes, rhetoric, poetry, ethics, morality, aesthetics, anthology (the study of existence), epistemology (the study of access to the world and understanding as such) in ancient philosophy and ancient Greece. Antiquity was highly generous in providing us with philosophical knowledge. Though we have preserved very little, to be honest. Nevertheless, <b>Plato and Aristotle's works have come down to us in their original form more or less. And we admit their incredible power to decipher the world</b>. We should make a caveat here: it surely can be explained by their way of life, which was slavery in its essence. Nevertheless, their powerful thoughts, relatively simple but powerful arguments have remained in European philosophy up to the 21st century. Again, it's not only my take on it. In the 20th century, Heidegger, for example, in one way or another, appealed to Heraclitus and Parmenides. And we constantly refer to Plato. In the 19th century, philosophers claimed that the 
</p>
<div align="center">
  <b><i>
    entire European philosophy was built on Plato's marginal<a href="#m7" id="w7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> notes
  </i></b>
</div>
<br>
It means, this type of thinking became a paradigm of European culture. Speaking of philosophy, I should say, it is incorrect to consider it in isolation. It is connected with history, with society, and, in many ways, is a culture development product. It also predetermines further culture development. Both things influence one another. I'd like to describe the <b>context in which philosophical ideas circulated</b>. So, let me say a few words about Greek culture. 

### GREEK CULTURE

1. **Verbal Culture**
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it started as a verbal culture. Ancient Greeks had not written anything down up until the 5th century BC. Before that, knowledge was transmitted verbally. Nevertheless, they say, there were the so-called Linear A and Linear B writing forms in pre-Homeric times. One of them has not been deciphered yet. There is a big question of how widespread these forms of writing actually were. And Homer, for example, most likely never wrote anything down. None of his writings has been preserved in the original. It is why the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> were learned by heart. These songs are written in hexameter<a href="#m8" id="w8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> to be learned and sung. They represent oral tradition. <b>Socrates found it dissatisfying that people used writing as a means for their memory to rest</b>. This way, writing, in some ways, disrupted the way humanity developed. By the way, <b>similar things were said when printing was invented</b>. Europe was not encouraged about it. In many ways, <b>people felt disappointed with books being accessible to anyone</b>.
</p>

2. **Culture of Competition**
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing I'd like to mention is that Greece developed a culture of competition. One competed against another. This competitiveness and the spirit of overcoming were at the heart of the Greek civilization. They could be found in any aspect of human activity. Remember the Olympic Games, which were an expression of a sport spirit of the ancient Greek civilization. The process, the act of overcoming, and suffering were highly significant for a Greek person. <b>Sport is a kind of realization of this movement</b> where it was extremely important to achieve the goal and win. The idea of doing sports, to be more accurate, of gymnastics, comes from Greece. By the way, ancient Greeks were educated in gymnasiums. "Gymnos" also means "naked," as ancient Greeks did sports naked. They were taught some corporal practices from the moment they turned seven. General body development was fundamentally important in ancient Greek culture. Besides, there was certain competitiveness at the political level.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to keep in mind, there were citizens, men who could vote, and there were women, children, slaves, having no such right. It was a type of <b>completely strict patriarchal society, which, in many ways, contributed to the development of ancient Greek philosophy, as bitter as it sounds</b>. This philosophy gave women very few rights. Speaking of the trial system, a trial was a certain competition of two speakers: one for the prosecution, the other for the defense. The accused defended themselves. It was a rhetorical battle, a competition. In essence, this is where rhetoric took root as an art of verbal argument. By the way, it fostered one of the poetic meters, that was of big importance in ancient Greece. Moreover, a competitive spirit was at the core of duels, sport, and theater, of course. Originally, theater stemmed from Dionysian mysteries. A theatrical performance lasted for at least four to five days. During three days, competitions in-between three tragedians were held. Each of them presented a triptych from a tragedy. Satire and drama were in the closing part of the performance. In the end, a winner was chosen among the participants. Thus, competition existed even in theatrical performances, not to mention everything else.
</p>

3. **Understanding of Cosmos, Fate**
4. **About Religion and Gods**
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a unified understanding of the cosmos in ancient Greece. The ancient Greek world was seen as entire, proportional, and beautiful. This was a cosmocentric culture. Gods and humans were believed to inhabit the same space, the same territory. Generally, ancient Greek gods are so very human. If you read Homer, you will get to see that gods betray, fight, or lie to each other. They sometimes behave worse than people. This is why gods are not moral authorities there; in ancient Greece, <b>it is philosophy that focuses on morality, not religion</b>, at least what we understand as religion. In essence, there was no religion in ancient Greece. It was a bit different. Gods were quite like humans. Apart from having supernatural features, being powerful, they were immortal. On the contrary, people were not. But gods were within easy reach: the ancient society maintained a relatively direct conversation with them. Gods were believed to give you support and help in some way if you made a sacrifice. They were not worshipped blindly, even though, of course, there was a culture of worship. But humans were thought to be able to communicate with them more directly than in Christianity.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The cosmos was built according to certain canons. In that cosmos, everything followed a structure, Moirai, fate. Gods and humans were ruled by fate. It was something they had in common. Ancient Greek culture started with Homer's epos, it started with poetry. <b>Ancient Greek writing originated in poetic writing. Actually, the understanding of the world found expression in poetry</b>. We can notice that in epos, the general prevails over the particular. A fateful determination prevails over the private and individual in ancient Greek culture. In essence, the ancient Greek civilization moved from the dominance of the general to that of the specific, to the individual way of world perception. This was the way ancient Greek dramaturgy developed. An important thing to understand here is that
</p>
<div align="center">
  <b><i>
   Fate was just a power that brought harmonious and proportional order to the cosmos
  </i></b>
</div>
<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, this is where the ancient Greek aesthetic comes from. Ancient Greek art rested on the principle of proportions and beauty. Everybody had their place in that harmonious cosmos. And the best scenario one could realize in life was to occupy the right place in it. The moment a person or a god violated that harmony, the cosmos brought them back to their place. In Aeschylus's <i>The Oresteia</i> Agamemnon kills his daughter, after that he gets killed by his wife, and then Orestes comes and kills his own mother, Agamemnon's wife. Thus, there is a whole cosmos and there is a law of predestination, a law of fate. Humanity and all gods occupy a certain place in it. <b>You will succeed if you restore the harmony of that cosmos</b>.
</p>

5. **Attention to the form**
6. **Not Cognition, But Contemplation**
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's also worth mentioning, in the ancient Greek world attention was always paid to the form, to the external rather than the internal. Their religion is public, at least what we understand as religion. For instance, Parmenides told us that "Being exists and non-being does not exist." That was a crucial idea. Ancient Greek texts of the later period were never written to be read in silence. They were read out loud. Generally, such kind of introspection was not common in Greek culture before Socrates. Hence, <b>the main activity of ancient Greeks was contemplation. It gave people an understanding of beauty and knowledge of the world</b>. The word "theoria" in ancient Greek means "contemplation." We are familiar with the image of Homer as a blind prophet, that was well-known for the entire ancient Greek civilization. All we know about him is that seven or nine cities claimed to be his birthplace, and most likely, he was a blind old man. <b>Society highlighted his disability because physical blindness was believed to allow metaphysical contemplation. This way, Homer not only had an idea of the sensual world, but he also saw a bit more</b>.
</p>

7. **Rationality and order of the universe are reflected in Logos**
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logos means principles of knowledge.
<p>
  
### Conclusion
<p>
As I have already said, the greatest thing you could do was to take your place in the cosmos. The world is harmonious, ordered, and beautiful. The human is an integral part of this world, just like gods. In conclusion, I would like to list what lay at the basis of ancient Greece: rhetoric, explicitness, and the logos. <b>Epos-Mythos-Logos</b>, according to various sources, is translated as "word." I intentionally phrase it a bit awkwardly because Logos, Mythos, and Epos can be understood differently. But they are all united by the meaning "word." So, Greek culture was a verbal culture. That is why contradictions were solved with words. People were either executed or, on the opposite, acquitted with words. This is how important the art of wording was. In addition, the philosophers of the 20th century found inspiration in the idea of philosophy being art that could construct the truth verbally.
