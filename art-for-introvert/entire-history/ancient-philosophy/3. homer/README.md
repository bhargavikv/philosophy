# Homer

Let us say a few words about Homer. 
<p>
Most likely, he lived around the 8th century BC and told the story about the Trojan War, which had taken place 200-300 years before. However, we saw a documented version of the Iliad and the Odyssey in the 6th century BC only, two centuries after the approximate date of Homer's death. And of course, there is a <b>question of the authorship of the Iliad and the Odyssey</b>. According to one theory, they were created by wandering poets that told myths. You remember that the Iliad describes the 10th year of the siege of Troy (in reality, there were slightly more than 50 days of the siege.) And the Odyssey tells the story of Odysseus, on his way back home to Ithaka after the Trojan War. We see pieces of general myths, which were familiar to all ancient Greeks.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Iliad and the Odyssey are controversial texts. Sometimes they seem to have been compiled from different sources. But anyway, they lie at the foundation of European culture. Homer formed basic paradigms, basic patterns of European literature. As it was said by some researcher, <b> the entire European literature is divided into the Iliad and the Odyssey. </b>And there is an element of truth in this phrase. He formed the  cultural paradigms that can be found in the medieval journey of a soul to God, in Dante's Divine Comedy, in Goethe's Faust, in Joyce's Ulysses, in Don Quixote: they all narrate about a path. A European is an eternal traveler, an ever-returning prodigal son. It is all encompassed in the tradition of the development of Odysseus's image. And Homer's contribution is paramount here.

### ABOUT HIS TEXTS

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, they delineate real gods, letting the reader actually grasp what human-like gods were like. Gods were participants of wars. They helped humans and gave them weapons, fought, and reconciled. That means, gods took an active part in the events of the Iliad and the Odyssey. I must say, Homer's texts were written in a language no one spoke. To be more accurate, they combine almost all dialects of the ancient world. It wasn't the language of a particular island or a polis. Essentially, Homer created a universal compilation. This is why there are questions about whether it was one person or a group of poets, whose art goes by his name. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind that Homer's works are not rife with any psychologism. In Homer's interpretation, a <b>human is a vessel which collects the gestures, emotions, and passion conveyed by gods</b>. The Iliad starts with Achilles' anger. But anger is not something Achilles is born with. It is Ares' anger that comes to him and is manifested through him. I continue the idea that the ancient Greek world is the world of the demonstrated, of the external. This is why the motivation of the characters and all their feelings, passion, and emotions can be clearly seen. They are finely demonstrated. It is not an inner world, it always is the world of the external, which is characteristic of Homer's works.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we should understand that every new generation forms a new interpretation of classic texts. By the way, it is quite common in Europe. But we should keep in mind that, by translating Homer even today, we enrich our culture and language. We do not just retell Homer. This is why the diversity of interpretations that appears in culture is so highly valued.

### SOME PHILOSOPHICAL TERMS

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we start discussing the first philosophers, I would like to recall the basic terms. In general, philosophy strongly depends on language. It is closely connected to it. Now let me touch upon some subject terms. First of all

  - <b>Ananke</b>, Inevitability<a href="#m2"><sup>[1]</sup></a> (necessity<a href="#m2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>). It is a force that drives cosmic motion and reconstitutes order. (or) It is an ancient philosophical term describing the power, coercion, or necessity that defines human actions and cosmic events
  - <b>Arete</b>, means valor.<a href="#m3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> expression of one's maximum potential

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, it is impossible to translate philosophy, because it is in close connection with the cultural paradigm, with language. So, the word "valor" is now interpreted completely differently than it was in the past. When we attempt to decipher an old culture and ancient philosophy with a modern conceptual apparatus and within the modern category system, we fail to fulfill the task. So, we should not use the word "justice," for example, the way we understand it today when we talk about Greece. In Greece, justice meant something completely different. Therefore, our task will always be to delve into the way of thinking characteristic of a culture. When we study the history of ancient times and those coming next, the history of Europe, there's no point in reading it in a contemporary way. It does not make any sense to try to apply our modern 
understanding of valor to ancient valor since they do not correspond. Our task is to shift from the perspective of our time. Only this way we'll get close 
to the real meanings. This is why we will look into the language and concepts within the culture.
</p> 
  Remember, one was supposed to occupy a harmonious place in this world and realize one's fullest potential, extreme valor. "Dike" is very 
similar. It is the order of things that has nothing to do with morality. The order of things was the basis of that cosmos, and its violation inevitably 
lead to punishment. If you violate the order of the world, be ready to pay for it. Agamemnon kills his daughter, so he should be prepared for the punishment 
that will come after. Therefore, justice is a way to preserve the proportions of the cosmos. The 
concept of "metron" should also be pointed out here. Justice is a measure-based order that has a geometric nature. It comprises order (dike) and also a 
number and a rhythm: arithmos and rhythmos. Remember, ancient Greek culture took roots from a poetic language â poetry has a rhythm and a certain structure. 
Thus, this "measure" of the language can be found in poetry. We see that in the way Greek understood justice, it was an order based on a certain measure. 
The proportionality and beauty of the world can be mathematically measured. Knowledge of mathematics and geometry was highly praised in ancient Greece. 
According to a legend, there was an inscription above the entrance to Plato's academy: "Let None But Geometers Enter Here," so one was encouraged to get to 
possess some knowledge about physical measures and laws of world harmony. Then, theoria, or theory, which 
was already discussed today, was contemplation and the most admirable activity. Now, let's move on to natural philosophy. Natural, or the pre-Socratic 
philosophy, was the first stage of the development of philosophy. Its main objective was to disclose the world's foundations. First of all, Pre-Socratic 
philosophy strived for overall knowledge and explanation. Pre-Socratics sought to find the source of everything. They were not interested in particular 
phenomena. Let me quote Thales, the first philosopher, although this quote is likely to have been invented. Thales stated that everything comes from water 
and gets back to it. The goal of the first philosophers was not in resolving separate issues but in providing a thorough explanation of the universal 
mechanism of the world, nature, the primordial essence of the world, and the origin of all things. This is why it had to appeal to natural phenomena. Then, 
as Pythagoras believed, everything is diverse yet united. Unity comes from multiplicity, which makes 
a system. Ancient people considered the world as structured yet very simple. They tried to find the simplest possible way to answer the original question. 
Just like the name of "natural philosophy" implies, its main goal was to cognize the world of nature around. Well, let's talk about philosophers, associated 
with it. 
So, the first one is Thales of Miletus. We hardly know anything about him now. Very little information has been preserved. Generally, we only have the 
remains of what was known about him. There barely exist any original materials of the first philosophers. They were mostly often examples of a verbal 
tradition, and for this reason, they were not preserved in the written form. Writings were either burnt in libraries or lost. We know about these 
philosophers from the narratives by other philosophers, and in this sense, we owe much to Aristotle, the first historian of philosophy. He never wrote the 
history of philosophy. But every time he started to analyze, say, happiness or some other concept, 
he suggested the way this phenomenon had been deemed by his predecessors. Through these retellings, we can discover the ideas of the first philosophers. 
For example, Thales. Aristotle calls him the first philosopher. Thales believed that everything was water, everything came from water. Then, let us touch 
upon Anaximander. According to him: "The things that are perish into the things out of which they come to be, according to necessity, for they pay penalty 
and retribution to each other for their injustice in accordance with the ordering of time." And I would like you to stop for a while and focus on that 
phrase. It reflects the essence of ancient Greek culture. "The things that are perish into the things out of which they come to be" means where things come 
from. The part "Into the things out of which they come to be" expresses the idea of cyclical time in antiquity. In Christianity, it is said: "In the 
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." In ancient times, time was deemed 
cyclical. The Histories of Herodotus, for instance, in many ways, describe the history of the past with no linear development of events. So, let's continue. 
"According to necessity" is about fate and destiny: you are always obliged to go back to the starting point. "For they pay penalty and retribution to each 
other." This phrase reveals an idea of exchange. "For their injustice according to the order of time" means that the moment you violate a rule, the cosmos 
brings you back to the starting point. Consequently, it costs you a lot of trouble soon after. This amazing example gives an overview of ancient Greek 
culture in just a few words. Let us continue with Heraclitus, the dark Heraclitus. Only a few things about him have come down to us. According to his 
philosophy, the key element is fire. That fire generates a constant change of the opposites, creating a cosmos in this eternal whirlwind.
