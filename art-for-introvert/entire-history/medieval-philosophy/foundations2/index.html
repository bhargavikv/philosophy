    <h2>PATRISTICS</h2>
    <p>
    Their predecessors were Apologetics<a id="w1" href="#m1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, upholding the Christian religion. To preserve 
     Christianity from heresy<a id="w2" href="#m2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, <b>early medieval philosophers called themselves patristics</b> (Latin for "holy fathers"), and they 
     sought to combine the fragmented Bible text into a unified, 
     more or less orderly array of knowledge. They used the Biblical text as a foundation to build a theory of the world, of man, and the universe. The brightest European minds 
     worked hard to come up with a single comprehensive vision. This was also documented by the earliest Ecumenical<a id="w3" href="#m3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
      Councils. Only in the 3rd century were Christian principles and dogmas<a id="w4" href="#m4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> finally codified. 
      The dogmas of Christianity changed regularly, especially in the first centuries. Even as early as the 1st century, the early Christians were continuously generating new ideas, introducing new doctrines, and reevaluating the old ones. Catholicism is no exception. Orthodoxy only considered the outcomes of the first few ecumenical councils, ignoring the ones after that. Catholics, on the other hand, are still in the process of creating a new doctrine. 
     For example, they just lately accepted the doctrine of Mary's immaculate conception or the doctrine of the pope's infallibility. 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In the early centuries of Christianity, the dogma was constantly evolving. 
     As a result, church fathers compiled a single canon that contained the core principles of the Christian faith. 
     The universal world order and cosmic harmony are considered as having a divine source and being created out of nothing (ex nihilo). In the Christian worldview and medieval philosophy, 
     this is both the first and most fundamental principle. Everything is made out of nothing by the divine. It's a crucial point. We'll get to this later when we talk about 
     how philosophy views this. Liturgy<a id="w5" href="#m5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>  and icon have taken the place of theater and idol as new symbols through which the 
     Christian community might communicate its aspirations. 
     There is a shift in the worship of faith from being internalized to being more externalized. 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     Icon painting relates to the unrealistic, transcendent, holy, and sacred since it 
     depicts the holy world. There is a way to yourself and to something truly external, but there is no way to the rest of the world. To put it another way, there is a 
     creation of God from which we cannot discern<a id="w6" href="#m6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
      God's essence. As a result, as St. Augustine believed, we should look into ourselves in search for the truth. 
     Parmenides once said, "There is being, but there is no non-being." 
     Due to the Christian worldview, the universe was created from nothing. This is a crucial part of Christianity's understanding of existence: "to be" is better 
     than "not to be." <b>Existence is preferable to a state of limbo</b><a id="w7" href="#m7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. 
     As the greatest good, the divine should exist. All medieval theologians and 
     philosophers sought to prove the existence of God, yet for Christian philosophy, God is an a priori concept. 
     Let's move on to discussing different schools of thought and philosophers.
    </p>
    <h2>Philo of Alexandria (25 BC - 50 AD)</h2>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     Medieval philosophy owed a lot to him. He <b>interpreted the Bible text allegorically</b>, arguing that the literal text is inconsistent and confusing, however, the 
     text can acquire some meaning when interpreted allegorically. Philo of Alexandria first noted that there is a concept of creation, stating that God created the 
     world and all existing things. He considered God to be more of an abstract entity rather than personified. God would grow more human-like as time passed. The 
     connection between the spirit and the body was a major challenge for medieval philosophy as a whole. 
    <b> Is there a connection between a mortal body and an immortal soul? </b>As Philo of Alexandria saw it,
     <div align="center">
      <b><i>
        "our soul is dead and buried in our body" 
      </i></b>
    </div> 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The idea of Logos was crucial to Philo of 
     Alexandria. Logos is the Greek word for "word," the divine Word that created the universe. Logos became a person and a driving force behind God's creation of the universe at the same time. 
     Logos is the main force by which God creates the world. Because of this, Logos came to represent God's son, a bridge between God and the rest of creation, including humans. 
     <b>Logos was not born as God or as people, but as an intermediary between the two, coinciding with both. </b>
     Logos is a person who represents and intercedes for people before God.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
      <b><i>
        God created matter out of nothing, and then gave it shape.
      </i></b>
    </div> 
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     Now, let us consider the concept of Creation. When the matter first appeared, it was formless. God has no beginning or end. He is the One who brought the universe into 
     being and rules it. Curiously, medieval philosophy has been hotly debated ever since the Middle Ages. 
     The quest on how to decode the biblical text is truly never-ending, and each person interprets it differently. As a result, there is a lot of disagreement on the ways 
     the Bible should be interpreted. Because this has been going on for so long, the Christian mind became sensitive to even the tiniest deviations from Christian theology. 
     The words "and from the son too" literally <b>stopped Catholicism and Orthodoxy from coming together</b>. This is the reason behind their dissolution. Medieval philosophy 
     benefited greatly from this kind of assimilation</b><a id="w8" href="#m8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> of the tiniest ideas from the Scriptures. 
     All of these seemingly insignificant matters became the foundation of the Christian religion. 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     For instance, a typical issue for consideration might be the number of angels that could fit in a needle's eye. For a medieval person, however, this was a debate 
     over what is an angel's essence. Are angels living things, or are they spiritual? Physical objects cannot fit in a needle's eye, but an unlimited number of 
     spiritual objects can. How many, if not infinity? 
     Such insignificant issues are complete and utter nonsense to us. 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     The biblical text used by Christianity and medieval philosophy was a conflicting document filled with oblique references and parables that were never 
     meant to be taken literally. To put it another way, whenever we attempt to apply rationality to Christianity, we face obstacles. It begs the question: 
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li> did God create the universe from nothing? </li>
    <li> How involved is God currently in the affairs of the world? </li>
    <li> Is He the Creator, or is He also the Ruler? </li>
    <li>As a Creator and Ruler, God has to be somewhere in the universe.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    These issues make us question ourselves on how complete our knowledge of the world really is. Is it comprehensible? Does it make any sense? <b>Because if we think 
    of God as a Creator, He can only discover Himself in the already-created universe by a miracle, an occurrence, which denies the existence of 
    cause and effect in the universe</b>. However, if God is in charge, He is both present in the world and aware of His own being there. 
     He is the only reality. These are important questions to reflect on. A person's life has three distinct aspects: the physical; the intellectual(rational), 
     and the divine. This is a well-known combination. In the physical world, we have a body; talking about intellect, we have reason and knowledge 
     (what we know), and the divine aspect comprises what we aspire to. Which do you prefer: reason or faith? Is it beneficial or counterproductive? 
     To be frank, there are many questions raised by the interplay of these three aspects. 
    </p>

    <h2>GNOSTICISM</h2>
    <p>
     Gnosticism is another philosophical model and intellectual discipline that had a significant impact on early Christianity and early medieval philosophy. 
     "Gnosis" is a Greek word that means "knowledge." The Church fathers condemned Gnosticism as heresy. The most important factor was having enough 
     information. There was a feeling of supremacy and secrecy among Gnostics. They were believed to be endowed with perfect mystical knowledge. 
     According to Gnostic systems, the struggle of light and darkness, good and evil is a natural phenomenon. Everything has two origins: one spiritual and 
     heavenly, the other earthly and human. Against this low and fleshly darkness, there lies a spiritual, greater light.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
      <b><i>
        The foundation of the universe is duality.
      </i></b>
    </div> 
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The adherents of the movement said that evil was not created by God and that the world was full of it, but 
     classical Christianity holds that the world is a blessing from the divine, and God gave us life. Because we are made of flesh, they claimed <b>it is not 
     God who rules the world, but rather Demiurge</b><a id="w9" href="#m9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>. <b>We are exiles in this world; our true home is somewhere out of the world. We should focus on 
     self-knowledge in order to return to the spiritual world(homeland), which is where we really belong. As Jesus said, "Whoever discovers the world has found a 
     corpse and world is not worthy of the one who has found the corpse." </b>
     Mortal beings are treated in this manner. This was considered heresy by the traditional Christian church. 
     Gnostics claimed the universe was cursed by Demiurge, a depraved Creator, and that one should strive for something better. 
     They were deemed as possessing supernatural knowledge or even powers over reality. Christianity quickly suppressed Gnosticism. 
    </p>
    <h2>Tertullian (155 - 220 AD)</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    As a theologian, he is regarded as one of the greatest ever. He is the <b>first Christian thinker who wrote in Latin</b>. Before that, they wrote in ancient Greek, 
    and many thinkers followed them in using ancient Greek as their primary language. <b>Latin was the primary language of medieval philosophical texts</b>. 
     Divine truth can only be discovered through faith. Tertullian held that the only way to understand the Bible is to take its literal meanings as gospel 
     truth<a id="w10" href="#m10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. The universe was created by God from nothing. God is the one who created everything, the source of all time and goodness (for He created 
     the world). God is the same as the things He made, including the universe. 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Tertullian believed, the Bible is a collection of sacred scriptures 
     that convey divine logic to human beings. He argued for a <b>literal interpretation of the Bible</b>. Therefore, the fact that we are unable to comprehend 
     some of the things in the Scriptures is normal. 
     In comparison to the divine, we are limited by our own knowledge. Let me cite an idea by him.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
      <b><i>
        "I believe because it is absurd."
      </i></b>
    </div> 
    <p>
      He deemed studying 
     philosophy a sinful pursuit and flatly denied having any sort of philosophical background. <b>Faith is anything that defies the laws of logic and 
     empirical observation</b>. Faith is illogical because it implies divinity, which is ludicrous<a id="w11" href="#m11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> in and of itself. 
     Knowledge is only useful in the mortal realm; it has no bearing on existence on a high spiritual dimension.
    </p> 
    <h2>Origen (185 - 254 AD)</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      He made the first attempt in the history of Christianity to systematically present dogmas. As a philosopher, he is best known for his 
     work on the "trinity" and <b>how the divine and the trinity are interconnected</b>. The idea of intangibility<a id="w12" href="#m12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>, 
     perfection, and infinity of 
     Christendom was first introduced by him. For this reason, there is no physical evidence for God. God is immaterial; He is perfect, 
     absolute, and good. He is the sum of all things, the sum total of reality. 
     It's difficult to demonstrate the trinity in three faces at the same time and three faces in one, which is why it's so controversial. 
     Origen developed the concept of the One, absolute and indivisible, which was opposed to the diverse world. While the earthly plains are numerous, 
     God is one.
