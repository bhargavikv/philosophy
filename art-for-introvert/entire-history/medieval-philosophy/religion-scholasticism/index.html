    <h2>Aurelius Augustine (354 - 430 AD)</h2>
   <p>
    St. Augustine, on the other hand, is unquestionably the <b>most significant medieval philosopher</b>.
   His mother was a devout Christian and his father was a pagan<a id="w1" href="#m1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> ; so, he had an unusual upbringing. Augustine was 
   a late convert to Christianity. He was brought up and got an education as a Roman rhetoric<a id="w2" href="#m2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> . At a certain point in time, he was inspired by Cicero. 
   After that, he experimented with Manichaeism<a id="w3" href="#m3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>  and skepticism<a id="w4" href="#m4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> 
    before giving up on both. Consequently, he attained divine revelation. For him, 
   reflecting on his life's journey was critical. 
   Augustine was one of the earliest Church fathers to be deeply contemplative, and fully aware of his lengthy and arduous<a id="w5" href="#m5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> 
    path to the church. Augustine is a 
   significant figure in the history of Europe, philosophy, and medieval thought. 
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>The <b>Christian worldview was firstly systematized under his leadership</b>, and he sought to present it as a complete system and the sole valid teaching. </li>
     <li>He proclaimed the <b>pursuit of happiness to be the basic element of human life</b> and saw it in meditation and understanding of full dependence on God.
      According to him, the highest happiness is a sense of insignificance before God and a deep love for Him.
     </li>
     <li>In all his teachings, he emphasizes that God is the starting and ending point of human thought and action. </li>
   </ul>  
   <p>Let's delve more into his ideas.</p>
   <h3>1. GOD AND THE WORLD </h3>
   <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
   The finite world and man were created by God out of His kindness. He is the One who guides human destiny, that becomes divine providence<a id="w6" href="#m6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. 
   The Universe and people's affairs are governed by God. Because God is the highest manifestation of purpose, good, and truth, which brings about peace, the entire world, including nature, is reliant on Him. 
   God does not stop caring for the world for a moment. The world is seen as overfilled with miracles, incomprehensible to the human mind events and phenomena happening at the 
   will of the almighty Creator. Thus, it was critical to put focus on miracles, particularly in the early years of Christianity (for example, the story of Christ is the story of miracles). 
   <b>If anything miraculous happens, it means, God has intervened in His own creation to show that He exists. </b>
   St. Augustine strongly believed in this. The whole reality is unfathomable. There is the eternal and unchanging supreme world of being and the continuously changing world of 
   transient<a id="w7" href="#m7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> things. Our only option is to pursue love and a connection to God. 
   </p>
   <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
   We are created in image and likeness of God, <b>we have the privilege of being related to the divine</b>. 
   Only by accepting ourselves on the inside, understanding ourselves and life on the inside, and connecting with our own spirits can we connect with God. 
   The essence of Augustine's theory of knowledge is a priori<a id="w8" href="#m8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>; God is the originator of all ideas and concepts. What we're looking for we can 
   find only within ourselves and 
   nowhere else. <b>Faith and reason mutually supplement each other</b>: "Understand to trust, believe to understand." Reasoning serves to support faith. The mind allows us to develop 
   clearer and more profound faith in God. 
   Overcoming contrariness and submitting to God's will is the way to freedom. 
   Because God has superior knowledge, the ultimate truth, Christianity views freedom as the most complete obedience to God's logic. In other words, you cannot achieve something 
   better than what the Almighty has already ordained<a id="w9" href="#m9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>. 
  </p>
  <div align="center" style="line-height: 1.4">
    <b><i>
      The emergence of evil is directly related to our capacity for free will. <br>
      It's the source of all evil in the world. <br>
      There would be no harm if we surrendered our free will to God.
    </i></b>
  </div>
  <p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
    To describe free will and evil in this way is truly fascinating. One of the major philosophical issues in 
    medieval times was trying to figure out how evil entered the world if God is the sum of all good. In the Middle Ages, God always guides and protects you no matter what you're going through. 
   As a result, theologians and philosophers tried a variety of ingenious explanations to explain why evil exists in the first place, all of which pointed to human 
   agency<a id="w10" href="#m10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. 
   God bestowed free will on us, but we don't make good use of it. If we followed God's plan, we'd be good, and there'd be nothing bad in the world. 
  </p>
  <div align="center" style="line-height: 1.4">
    <b><i>
       Do not go outside, go back to yourself <br>
       the truth exists inside man
    </i></b>
  </div>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Moving deeply into oneself is the way to self-understanding, according to these principles. Instead of looking for truth in the outside world, one should turn within, because it is 
  the only place where it can be found. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
    Here is another quote by Augustine. The passage we'll touch upon contains far too many quotations to make sense on its own. To convey Augustine's rhetoric is impossible; 
    it is a thrill before divine truth, an awareness of one's own insignificance, and apologies for the attempts to get closer to God's truth. 
  </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><b>
        "We [Earth and Sky] exist because we are created: <br>
         we were not there until we appeared and we could not appear by ourselves. <br>
         And this voice is confirmed by this very obviousness. <br>
        So, Lord, you created them; You are beautiful and they are beautiful; <br>
        You are good and they are good; You exist and they exist. <br>
        They are not as beautiful, as kind as you, and exist not as you, their Creator."
      </b></i>
    </blockquote>
  <p>
     So, the creation of God is inseparable from God. God is the reason for the existence of all things, all the changes; He not only created the world, 
     but also completely preserves it, continues to create it. 
   God is also the most important subject of knowledge and the cause of knowledge. Every aspect of life has a connection with the divine. As created by God, the world 
   is an intelligent creation. It was made from nothing according to His plan. The world is full of accidents, but the act of creating the world itself was not 
   accidental. Only in God can true happiness be found. 
   </p>
   <h3>2. ETERNITY AND TIME </h3>
   <div align="center" style="line-height: 1.4">
    <b><i>
      Having created transient things, <br>
      God created a measure of their change
    </i></b>
  </div>
   <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
   Augustine's concept of time is revolutionary. The world is made "out of nothing" (ex nihilo). It is still very important. Augustine held that <b>time did not exist before the world 
   came into being, but rather appeared as a result of the divine creation</b>. There was no such thing as time in the sense that we understand it before the world was 
   created. Only since the act of creation of the mortal plane has there been time and movement. According to Augustine, there is no past or future. 
   <b>Human memory preserves the past, while hope for the future inspires the present. We only exist in the present moment.</b> At the time, it was revolutionary to have 
   a subjective personal concept of time. It's not even close to being out-of-date at this point. Rather, we think of the present as a point in time, from which 
   we refer to the past. In this way, Augustine's writings are still relevant today. 
   </p>
   <h3>3. GOOD AND EVIL </h3>
   <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
   He had a unique perspective on good and evil, which is fascinating. His idea is that <b>everything is good but to different degrees</b>, evil does not really exist 
   by itself. As silence is a lack of noise, nudity is a lack of clothing, illness is a lack of health, and darkness is a lack of light, so <b>evil is a lack of 
   good, not something that exists by itself</b>. I believe it is the finest and most authoritative explanation for why evil exists. 
   </p>
   <div align="center" style="line-height: 1.4">
    <b><i>
      The world is created by one and only God <br>
      and being his best creation, the world is the best of all possible worlds.
    </i></b>
  </div>
   <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
   True freedom is found in a sincere desire to serve God. The absence or incompleteness of good is a violation of God's order, and this is what evil is. Evil is largely predetermined 
   by the fact that it can appear from an act of free will of a person. While the world may be filled with evil, a person is to blame for it because of their 
   free choice. Sin is a rebellion of a mortal body against an immortal soul. There would be no harm in the world if we followed the logic of the divine and acted accordingly. 
   </p>
   <h3>4. PERSON AND KNOWLEDGE </h3>
   <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
   The world created by God is a hierarchical structure established by Him once and for all. The <b>foundation is constituted by lifeless objects. Above them are plants, 
   which not only exist but also live, and animals, that have the ability to sense. And, of course, there are human beings, the only creation which are endowed with soul</b>. 
   Philosophers in medieval times had no qualms<a id="w11" href="#m11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> about attempting to gain a better understanding of the world around them, but 
   this understanding was far more simplified than that developed by New Age thinkers. Their goal was to convey the gradation of God's creations of the surrounding world. 
   </p>
   <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
   Augustine, one of the early philosophers of patristics, placed a strong focus on love. 
   He penned a lengthy essay in which he described the existence of two cities: The City of Babylon and Jerusalem. The Civitas Terrestris and the Heavenly City arise 
   from two types of love: love for oneself up to disdain<a id="w12" href="#m12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>  for God, and love for God up to self-oblivion. The first praises itself, the second - God. 
   The first seeks human glory, the second aspires to the highest glory of God. "<b>Love for oneself brought to contempt for oneself as a sinful creature, is love for 
   God, and love for oneself brought to contempt for God is a vice</b><a id="w13" href="#m13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>."
   Everything is again based on love. Augustine saw our attitude toward God as an act of love, and contemplation of the true God as the purest kind of love. 
  </p>
  <h2>Boethius (480 - 524 AD)</h2>
  <p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   He was called the <b>"last Roman"</b>. A philosopher who had the ambitious goal of translating all of the antique philosophy into Latin. Unfortunately, 
   he didn't realize<a id="w14" href="#m14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. his brilliant plan. It's worth noting some of the fundamental ideas by Boethius. 
   First, that <b>existence of the imperfect - in any order - implies the existence of the perfect</b>. This is a way to demonstrate God's perfectness to the human mind and heart. 
   Bliss is state of perfection, consisting of the possession of all the benefits. God is bliss Himself. God's constant observation of our free will does not 
   infringe<a id="w15" href="#m15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>. on our freedom. He provides, not anticipates; His name is not "foresight," but "providence". 
   The question is:
  </p>
  <div align="center">
    <b><i>
      how to reconcile one's free will with the will of God, who predetermined everything? 
    </i></b>
  </div>
  <p>
   A human has a mind that is capable of knowing and making choices, hence their will is free. The better a human uses reason, the more free they are. 
   God possesses perfect knowledge and His judgment is indispensable; therefore, freedom is complete. It can be measured by how strongly a 
   person is committed to God's will. The more we surrender our free will to God, the more good can be actualized through us. 
  </p>
    <div align="center">
      <b><i>
        To want what the body wants is the extreme degree of slavery <br>
        To want what God wants and to love what He loves is the highest freedom and therefore happiness
      </i></b>
    </div> 
  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   Yielding to carnal<a id="w16" href="#m16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>. desires is the extreme form of slavery, reconciliation with God is the highest freedom and, therefore, happiness. 
   Submission to divine logic is the highest realization of human freedom and happiness. It is the inner idea prevailing in the Christian world. 
  </p>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="logical-square.png" alt="logical square image" width="300" height="300"><br>
    <b>Logical square of opposition</b>
  </div>
  <p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
   There is one more thing about Boethius that we know. He's a brilliant thinker and one of the best logicians. He liked the ideas of Aristotle. 
   He formed the so-called logical square of the opposition representing the relations between the four basic categorical propositions. Between them, 
   there are certain ways of interaction, certain structures. Indeed, the Middle Ages were marked by an increased interest in logic. 
   Logic was the cornerstone of Boethius. The logical method of understanding or aiding in knowing the divine would be revealed later on in scholastics. 
  </p>
  <h2>SCHOLASTICISM</h2>
  <p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
   Scholasticism is the second major school of medieval philosophy. 
   It started somewhere in the 10th-11th centuries. Scholastic heavily contributed to European education, to medieval universities. As faith grows, 
   it moves in the direction of rationalism. The latter and logic were adopted as the means for cognizing the divine. At this point, theology 
   evolved into a rigorous logical system of thought. The first thinker of scholastic is Anselm of Canterbury. 
  </p>
  <h3>Anselm of Canterbury (1033 - 1109 AD)</h3>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
   He considered faith to be the basis of rational knowledge. 
   In other words, he deduced God's existence from the concept of God itself. This is pure logic. God surpasses everything conceivable. 
   So, He exists outside of us and outside of this world. In reality, God is greater than a being that exists only as an idea in the mind. 
   If God exists only as an idea in the mind, now we can imagine something that is greater than God. But it is impossible. Therefore, God exists. 
   This is called <b>ontological</b><a id="w17" href="#m17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> <b>proof of the existence of God</b>. 
   It is one of the most minimalistic and beautiful - it is very concise, very logical. 
  </p>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="proof-1.png" alt="ontological-proof image" width="650" height="350"><br>
  </div>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
   This sequence of reasoning can be rethought in a new way. Everyone strives for God - but God is the Absolute Good. 
   Everything is limited and has a certain upper limit. That's the creator, the almighty. For some reason, being is synonymous with being a whole. 
   That's God, completeness itself. Yet, we cannot think out a being that is greater than God. Thus, we conclude that God exists.
