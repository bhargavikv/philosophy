    <h2>Peter Abelard (1079 - 1142 AD)</h2>
    <p>
    He's very important. As a result of his unfortunate circumstances, he was compelled to become a monk<a id="w1" href="#m1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. 
    Although most people were drawn to faith 
    and the divine at the time, Abelard was a rational thinker who did not shy away from advocating logic and reason. He had no qualms about 
    demonstrating the <b>superiority of knowledge over blind faith</b>. For the time period, this was a radical<a id="w2" href="#m2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
     thought. Moreover, he denied the dogma 
    of original sin. Abelard posited<a id="w3" href="#m3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. that divine love was a reward for morally valuable acts 
    rather than a precondition for such behaviour. He 
    believed that love is not something that was originally given to us, not some experience, but something we need to deserve. This way, another 
    stone, on which classical understanding of Christianity was built, was thus removed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    He believed a person's actions are inextricably linked 
    to their intentions. Therefore, a sin is an act committed by a person contrary to their conviction<a id="w4" href="#m4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. That is, sin is what a person does in 
    spite of themselves. Abelard's view: knowledge is what is beneficial to our well-being because it demonstrates a sound principle of 
    rational understanding. Here are some <b>guidelines on how to think more clearly</b>, according to Abelard: (Rules of knowledge)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first rule is to analyze a text, terms should be defined according to their historical and linguistic context. </li>
      <li>The second rule is to clearly analyze the authenticity of the text and its author and to detect random substitutions and interpolations. </li>
      <li> The third rule is to check questionable text parts within the entire writing of an author by comparing them with the originals. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Peter Abelard was truly an outstanding philosopher. He violated the 
    foundations of the church in a variety of ways. He said that <b>Christianity has no right to claim to be the only source of truth, there 
    is a grain of truth in all religions</b>. The main thing Abelard demanded was the purity of moral intentions. You should not condemn<a id="w5" href="#m5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
    people for their "seeming"<a id="w6" href="#m6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
     sinfulness: only God knows the truth. Therefore, you need to be very careful making judgments on the sins of others. 
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Abelard was of the opinion that <b>doubt is where all investigation begins. "I understand to believe"</b>. This is a scientific principle, not 
    a philosophical one. <b>True faith can only be attained by doubting our understanding. Intention, not deed, determines whether or not a 
    person is a sinner</b>. (where intention means the aim/purpose and deed means the action)
    Sin is defined as the willful acceptance of wrongdoing. Unintentional sin carries no moral weight in God's eyes if 
    it's committed without intent or knowledge. That is, if someone does something out of malice<a id="w7" href="#m7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, 
    it is a sin; if they do something 
    unintentionally, they are innocent because they had no intention of doing it on purpose. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The distinction between vice and sin is that 
    the former is a proclivity<a id="w8" href="#m8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
     to sin, while the latter is a sin in and of itself. Pleasure is not a sin, but giving your mind over to 
    it is. Rather than placing sin at the moment of creation, Abelard saw it as something we do consciously. Human sinfulness can be 
    overcome through repentance<a id="w9" href="#m9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>. At the same time, 
    fear of punishment should not be the driving force behind repentance; instead, it 
    should be driven solely by a desire to please God. The punishment has to be chosen by the repentant themselves. The most important 
    thing is to turn to God in repentance. A struggle, with all its all contradictions, unfolds in the soul of a person, in their 
    conscience, a struggle aimed at achieving virtue. Unintentional sin or sin committed inadvertently because of ignorance, is not 
    punishable by God. Peter Abelard denied the original sin and the sins of the pre-Christian pagans. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The life and teachings of Jesus 
    serve as a guide for us to follow. Humanity was not saved by Christ's resurrection and ascension to heaven; rather, it was taught 
    pure morals. Original sin does not exist because it was not our intention. Because we didn't want to commit sin, there's no mark 
    of original sin on us. We must not admit or repent for the sins of our fathers. Abelard said, that "Sin is, therefore, not in the lust 
    of a woman, but in an agreement to lust. <b>Not a fleshly desire is condemned, but consent</b>
    <a id="w10" href="#m10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> <b>to it</b>." Abelard argues that consent is 
    the real sin. Abelard's theory is one of the most difficult ethical theories. There is a parable, a man comes home and enters his 
    dark bedroom to find his wife asleep on the bed, as she should be. He goes to bed and makes love with her. And in the morning he 
    finds out that it wasn't his wife. This is not a sin, according to Abelard. Because the man had no intention of committing the sin, 
    he is not guilty of it.
    </p>
    <h2>Thomas Aquinas (1225 - 1274)</h2>
    <p>
     A key figure in medieval philosophy, he is well-known and can be 
    called the <b>personification of scholasticism</b>. Thomas Aquinas began with the idea that there are numerous ways to acquire knowledge. 
    Science and religion are diametrically opposed when it comes to the means by which they arrive at truths. Science and philosophy, 
    in his opinion, must contribute to the development of faith. 
     For Aquinas, first and foremost, something cannot be unless it has an act of being, and the thing that has an act of being is 
     thus transformed into a composite essence/existence. As long as the essence is acting, the act of being is constrained by the 
     essence that is acting. Metaphysics of Thomas Aquinas :
    <ul>
      <li>All being is one</li>
      <li>All being is true</li>
      <li>All being is good</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Thomas Aquinas believed the mind can be wrong, while faith relies on the absolute truthfulness of God. 
     The mind (reason) must serve faith. He considered philosophy a servant of theology. In God, essence and existence are one and the same,
     in things they are different.
     After antiquity, it was Thomas Aquinas who first introduced the concepts of essence and existence as having the same source 
     in God. People don't exist in and of themselves; they exist as a part of the divine creation. Hence, the world does not exist 
     on its own but because of something different; whose existence is identical to being, and this is God. We live in a universe 
     where existence and essence are incompatible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
     One of the intriguing points raised by Thomas Aquinas in his work is the 
     <b>gathering of evidence of God's existence</b>. These are Aristotelian ideas that were significantly reworked. 
    <ul>
      <li>  
        So, the first proof is based on the concept of movement. If everything moves in the world, and if we retrospectively return through all 
        the diversity of movement, then we will come to the original source of movement, something which created momentum, the proof of movement. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The next is the proof built on the concept of the efficient cause. There must be a beginning to the course of events observed 
        in the Universe. If everything has a cause, we will eventually arrive at the root cause. That's God. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The third proof points out that any thing or event cannot come into being by chance. Nothing exists because of itself. The world, on 
        the whole, cannot be an accident. It, as a whole, is a manifestation of absolute necessity that only God can be. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The following proof is based on degrees of perfection. All things reveal different degrees of perfection, which, however, can only 
        be measured in relation to the absolute as the limit of perfection. It has to be God.
      </li>
      <li>
        The teleological<a id="w11" href="#m11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> proof is built on the principle of the appropriateness of everything existing. Everything exists and strives for 
        the best form. Therefore, there is a reasonable being that determines the purpose of everything real. This is God.
      </li>
    </ul>
     These ways to prove God's existence are simple, but when combined, they form a well-defined evidence system.
    </p>
    <h2>Duns Scotus (1266 - 1308 AD)</h2>
    <p>
     According to Duns Scotus' beliefs, a human is part of a natural 
     whole that can be explored regardless of their supernatural purpose and afterlife destiny. They can be investigated as a 
     component of the natural world. The human mind is capable of acquiring reliable knowledge of existence and is aware of what 
     is going on around. All cognition ultimately relies on the data of sensual perception. Our knowledge, which is bound up in 
     the sensual world, eventually leads to sensuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    As a result, only individuals exist, according to Duns Scotus; <b>forms and 
     entities ("whatness" of things) exist as well, but not realistically, but as objects of Divine intelligence</b>. He claims that 
     "you can know reality," but <b>only specifically existing things can be known, while the internal form can only be learned 
     intellectually</b>. The act of creation is a transition from the diminished existence of universals as divinely thought-about 
     objects to the real existence of individuals. So, we have common universals of objects that do not exist in reality but are 
     implemented as separate beings by the act of creation. Duns Scotus thought through and worked out the correlation between 
     philosophy and theology.

     Philosophy is concerned with the sensual world. Theology includes the topic of faith. Theology is 
     the path of persuasion, the path of utterance, while that of philosophy is leading to knowledge for the sake of knowledge 
     itself. Philosophy deals with abstractions, while theology deals with the revelation of God, revelation as a divine Word. 
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     At the end of the era of medieval philosophy, scholasticism began to develop along the line of science and mysticism
     <a id="w14" href="#m14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. 
    </p>
    <h2>William of Ockham (1285 - 1347 AD)</h2>
    <p>
     William of Ockham was the man who carried on the idea of two truth concepts. Theology is not a science, and philosophy 
     is not a servant of theology. Theology is a set of provisions linked together not by a rational sequence but by the 
     cementing power of faith. According to Ockham, the mind loses its ability to learn and deal with matters of faith. <b>The 
     mind cannot provide support for faith because it has nothing more transparent than what is given to faith in Revelation.</b> 
     Faith is already engaged in pure revelation, while the mind is preoccupied with other matters unrelated to faith. 
     Scholasticism has come to an end because scholastics believed that the mind helped to better understand faith; however, 
     since Ockham, mind and faith are separated. The notion that only the individual is real refers to the fact that only the 
     real world exists. In philosophy, we are most familiar with <b>Ockham's razor</b>.
     Ockham's razor is a great tool for thinking; don't create entities for no reason, and don't create extra entities. 
    </p> 
    <div align="center" style="line-height: 1.4;">
      <b><i>
        "Entities should not be multiplied in unnecessarily large number." <br>
        "A plurality should not be positioned arbitrarily." <br>
        "It is pointless to try to accomplish more with fewer resources."
      </i></b>
    </div>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     Medieval philosophy is more than just a relic of the past; it is also a very practical thing. Indeed, the philosophical 
     principles learned from the history of philosophy can be applied. We have a set of thoughts, which seem adequate and 
     to be common sense. All of these abridged thoughts that we see in popular science literature are borrowed from the 
     thoughts and concepts of great philosophers. We must understand the origins of ideas and recognize that when we see a 
     phrase in a book, it was most likely not invented by the author of that book. It is a product of European thought. This 
     course is intended to demonstrate the problem of the existence of philosophy in order to better understand what it is 
     needed for. 
    </p>
    <h2>Meister Eckhart (1260 - 1328 AD)</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    For ten centuries, Christian thought flirted with 
     the mind, engaging it at times and disengaging at others, but the background was constant. It was mysticism that understood 
     God's experience as a literal experience of revelation; not as the gospel, but as your own emotional revelation. Here we see 
     Meister Eckhart's greatest revelation: Deity is hidden behind the word "God," which means that "God" as Father, Son, and 
     Spirit is only a representation of the true God or Deity. <b>Because the foundations of God and the human soul are identical, 
     God or merger with God should be sought within oneself</b>: "In my soul, God gives birth to me as his Son." <b>God loses nothing by 
     giving us a piece of Himself. Because the flame suffers no loss when we bring it up and another candle is lit</b>. This is a 
     lovely thought. Antiquity was characterized by understanding the divine as external, and in the Middle Ages, God had to be 
     sought for within oneself. God can only be understood through sensual experience, not through the mind. Mystics saw God as a 
     direct emotional experience, not as intellectual, logical, and based on knowledge. It was at this point that scholasticism 
     began to take shape.
  </p>
    <p style="text-align:center"> 
    This concludes our discussion of medieval philosophy. Following that, we will discuss the Renaissance, <br>
     and then the New Age. We will witness the revival of antiquity, as well as the revival of Plato's school of thought.<br>  After that, 
     we will return to the New Age to learn where the new European science was born.
