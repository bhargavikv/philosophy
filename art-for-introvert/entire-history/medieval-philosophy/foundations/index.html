    Let's consider one more aspect of the Middle Ages. It is important for me that we understand it completely. We have a very important point in the Middle Ages that can often explain how a theologian or a 
    philosopher forms a thought. The <b>Middle Ages were a synthesis of intellectual and emotional realms</b>. The novels of the 19th century mislead us and make us believe that the Middle Ages are characterized by 
    fearless medieval knights in armor who go to fight for a beautiful lady, overlord, state, faith, and so on. In fact, the medieval mentality was incredibly emotional. The world always elicited a much more 
    emotional, primal, and sensual response. 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A medieval knight was not without fear and reproach<a id="w1" href="#m1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>; he was constantly losing consciousness as a result of the events he was witnessing and the emotions that 
    overpowered him. A medieval knight was a man who used to cry and lose consciousness on the battlefield. <b>Medieval people's lives were filled with intense emotions. So, among other things, any intellectual 
    activity was interpreted as strong-willed</b>. Of course, the central idea, the <b>central feeling that unites the entire Middle Ages, is a fear of the divine</b>. The divine, as in the picture of Bosch<a id="w2" href="#m2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, 
    sees us "naked." Nothing, not even clothing or social standing, will save us. The macabre<a id="w3" href="#m3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
     genre - dancing skeletons - blossomed and became extremely popular at the end of the Middle Ages. The images of 
    the genre show a man, a bishop, a king, and a dancing skeleton next to them, with the words "remember about death," and "death is always near." The never-ending fear pervades the entire life of a medieval 
    Christian, that is always empathetic and responsive. St. Augustine would say: 
    <div align="center" style="line-height: 1.3;">
      <b><i>
      "Who am I to comprehend the divine? <br>
      Give me the strength to comprehend You, and the courage to approach You. <br>
      I recognize how insignificant I am in understanding You." <br>
      </i></b>
    </div> 
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;"></p>
    With the impossibility of approaching divinity, there is a sense of insignificance of one's 
    own essence. There is a salvation, and only God can save you. "And the Church, which is given divine grace," Catholicism would add. The scholiasts that we will talk 
    about (those of the 12th-13th centuries) tried to cleanse the religious experience of emotionality and sensuality and give us some digest of it. The medieval people 
    lived in constant fear. History tells us that medieval culture is the culture of fasting and carnival, as it tells us: <b>"Laughter is the only way to completely get 
    rid of fear"</b>. For this very reason, medieval festivals and carnivals were real feasts in time of the plague: people ate, drank, and danced in cabarets and taverns 
    for days. It was such a fierce laugh - only this could save people from the feeling of constant insignificance - fear of the world and the divine. <br>
    Then you need to understand several intellectual foundations of medieval culture
    </p>
    <h2>NEOPLATONISM</h2>
    <p>
    As the name indicates, it is a <b>reformulation of Plato's ideas</b>. 
    Plotinus was the main and the most famous author of Neoplatonism. Neoplatonists engaged in a wide range of activities. One concept is crucial to us, and it reoccurred 
    throughout the Middle Ages. It is their understanding of being and the One that eventually became the Christian God. Neoplatonism flourished in the early Middle Ages, 
    between antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. The source of all things in the world is a supernatural force - the One. 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Neoplatonism is based on the ideas of Plato 
    but exaggerates his concept of Good as well as the blessing, which radiates all other ideas. They turned this blessing into the main part of their own philosophy. We read 
    Plato neoplatonically when we say that "there is a world of ideas and there is a world of forms." This is the basis of Neoplatonism, which is based not on Plato's texts, 
    but on the reading of them by Neoplatonists. This is very critical in philosophy. <b>The history of philosophy has a drawback. It very often turns philosophy into a 
    retelling of philosophy</b>. There is a difference between philosophy and history of philosophy. Very often in the history of philosophy, in the history of teachings, 
    these two concepts of philosophy are mixed. We often see that some philosophers take ideas that have come before them and explain them in such a way that they completely 
    change their meaning. For example, Neoplatonists took Plato's ideas and transformed them into something entirely new. As a result, we examine Neoplatonism rather than 
    Platonism. 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    According to Neoplatonism, <b>the source of all life and everything in the world is a supernatural force, the One</b>. Idealistic abstraction was thought to be 
    pure and simple unity, completely excluding multiplicity. Existence is divided into many parts, but the whole is indivisible. It is unrecognizable, inaccessible to 
    both the mind and senses. We can't say anything about this force because it's like some totality in the light of which we appear, 
    and we don't have any tools for comprehending it. The <b>One is the absolute which does not depend on anything, while all other existence depends on it - directly or indirectly</b>. 
    So there is the One that is independent, absolute, eternal, total, inseparable, and so on, and a variety of beings appear in its light or thanks to it. That is, unlike in 
    medieval Christianity, it is not stated here that the universal life force is personified. It is understood here as the supernatural force that emanates, literally radiates 
    all that exists.
    </p>
    <blockquote align="center" ><b><i>
      The One does not create, but radiates all other beings from itself.<br>
      Such radiation is central to Neoplatonism's emanation theology.
    </i></b></blockquote>
    <br>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <b>Christianity would borrow heavily from Neoplatonism</b>, imbuing<a id="w4" href="#m4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the Christian God with unique characteristics. Of course, Christianity arose from ancient 
    thought. That must be understood: Christianity, both at the beginning and at the end of its journey referred to ancient wisdom, intuition, ideas, and methods. 
    It is not that Christianity appeared out of nowhere; rather, it arose as a result of a specific intellectual tradition. Of course, Christianity tried to deny it 
    at times, but it also acknowledged that some ideas were borrowed from the Neoplatonism.
    </p>
    <h2>CHRISTIANITY</h2>
    <p>
   Speaking of medieval philosophy, we need to say a couple of words about 
    Christianity. Despite the struggle between faith and reason that lasted throughout the Middle Ages, Medieval philosophy is largely a servant of theology. 
    We'll talk about it, but first, we need to understand at least some framework of Christianity. We will not examine the history of Christianity, the life of Jesus, 
    and the gospel. We will talk about the philosophical foundations of Christianity.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
      <b>Theocentrism</b> - God is in the center of the world<br>
      <b>Creationism</b> - God is the creator of everything<br>
      <b>Providentialism</b> - history is the realization of God's design<br>
    </div>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The first is Theocentrism or God's position as the center of the universe. 
    Christendom<a id="w5" href="#m5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> is founded on and determined by the concept of God. All thoughts and relationships are built by the divine: sermons, confessions, and so on. 
    A person is understood through the divine. The world is understood to be God's creation and we are thought to be created in His image. God is the epicenter 
    and center of all meanings. The <b>Renaissance</b>, for example, <b>would transform the concept of Theocentrism into anthropocentrism</b>. It would elevate the concept of 
    a man to the same level. In Christianity, however, God is at the center of everything. God is the Creator of everything, according to Creationism. This was 
    an almost undisputed truth throughout the history of medieval philosophy. God is the Creator; He created the universe. There are more questions, but He is 
    the Creator. History, according to Providentialism, is the realization of God's design. God is aware of the entirety of reality. He is aware of what has 
    occurred and anticipates what will occur. In this sense, there is a lot of debate about whether or not a person has their own free will.
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <b>Throughout the Middle Ages, philosophers attempted to interpret the Bible text</b>. In fact, the entire history of European culture has been devoted to interpreting the Bible text 
    because it is so sophisticated. It can be read in at least four different ways. <b>Different interpretations of the biblical text led to completely different philosophical 
    concepts in the Middle Ages</b>.
    </p> 
    <b>1. Literary method</b>
    <p>
    There is literal interpretation, which raises many questions because, as you know, the Bible is contradictory and unclear. The gospel<a id="w6" href="#m6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
    is the most basic example. There are four gospels, each with its own plot. It appears that they should be the same, but some events are mentioned in some gospels 
    but not in others. Therefore, the literal interpretation often leads to the absence of logic and contradictions. The gospel is translated as "good news." This 
    is the message of the divine, and we think like humans - it is excusable for us to fail to understand God's word. Some Christians advocate interpreting the biblical 
    text literally. 
    </p>
    <b>2. Allegorical method</b>
    <p>
    Further, there is the allegorical method, according to which everything is interpreted as an allegory<a id="w7" href="#m7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.
    </p>
    <b>3. Moral method</b>
    <p>
     There is a moral method to understand the Bible text as some ethical, moral treatise. 
    </p>
    <b>4. Anagorical method </b>
    <p>
    The anagorical method leads to the ideal and displays some idealized perspective.
    </p> 
    <p>
    All four interpretation methods are equivalent.
    </p>

      <b><i>
        In Christianity, love is a generous gift.
      </i></b>
    </div> 
    <p>
    Christianity strongly depends on the concept of love. This comes from the Paul the Apostle. Love is a central 
    concept, but understood peculiarly. It is love for "another," "other," for the "divine" in its best manifestation. Love is, of course, 
    regarded as the ultimate and absolute truth. It is a form of communication, and Christian love is love that is given. Because love was largely understood in 
    antiquity as a formal cult of bodies and forms, this is moral love. The highest form of love is, of course, love for God. Love is a selfless gift. It is an 
    attempt to reclaim one's original integrity. Medieval love is the love given. It is compassionate love. Let us compare the following notions. Eros is 
    individual love, reciprocity<a id="w8" href="#m8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, and the beauty of the beloved. It's more antiquated<a id="w9" href="#m9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>. 
    Caritas is a family love that strives to overcome any suffering.

      <table>
