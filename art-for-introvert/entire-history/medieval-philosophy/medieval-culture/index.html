        We have covered antiquity, and I hope you remember everything we talked about, that everything begins with a myth, then comes natural philosophy, the pre-Socratic philosophy, 
        within the framework of which we studied Parmenides, Heraclitus and others, then we make an anthropological turn to Socrates. Remember his "I know that I know nothing"? Then we 
        moved on to his student Plato and talked about the world of ideas and the world of forms. Then there was the first history of philosophy and Aristotle as some sort of a conclusion. 
        We studied antiquity, which will be the recurring motif for all our lectures because it is the basis and the background for the entire history of philosophy, that's why we've 
        spent quite a lot of time discussing it.
    </p>
    <h1>Middle Ages</h1>
    <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
        <b style="margin: 0">Too boring lecture !!!</b><br>
        <p style="margin: 0.5em 0 0 0">Just go through the highlighted points (except for the differences part)</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        When we talked about antiquity, we started our conversation with culture; so, let's talk about the culture of the 
        Middle Ages. For a long time, the Middle Ages were <b>thought to be uninteresting from a cultural standpoint</b>. 
        All this started in Renaissance. 
    </p>
    <div align="center">
        <b><i>
            Renaissance,  is a moment of rebirth of antiquity. 
        </i></b>
    </div>
    <p>
        The neglect of the Middle Ages began from the Renaissance. Between the beautiful antiquity and the beautiful 
        Renaissance, we have 10 centuries when people, roughly speaking, were fighting each other in dirt and plagues. Nothing 
        beautiful or sublime<a href="#m1" id="w1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> happened. Therefore, Middle Ages were called the <b>Dark 
        Ages</b>. Philosophers did not dismiss the achievements of Middle Ages' intellectual thought. In culture and art, 
        however, this was not the case. <b>Only in the 19th century did they begin to understand the Middle Ages as an era with 
        its own sense of beauty</b>. In the 19th century, they began to explore the Middle Ages and to see aesthetics and beauty in 
        Gothic cathedrals, in miniature books. They began to see that, despite their darkness, ruin, and decay, the Middle Ages 
        were marked by a delicate sense of the divine. 
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Middle Ages invented the concept of symbol and introduced it to European culture. Starting from the 19th century, 
        we begin to realize the Middle Ages as an era filled with meaning, beauty, and values. This era is magnificent. It is the 
        moment of the beginning of some general humanitarian<a href="#m2" id="w2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> thought. Therefore, we have 
        a huge amount of research of what Gothic architecture is, for example.
    </p>
    <h2>MEDIEVAL PHILOSOPHY AND CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY</h2>
    <div align="center">
        <b><i>
            Philosophy of the Middle Ages is strongly tied to Christian theology<a href="#m3" id="w3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
        </i></b>
    </div>
    <p>
        It was the time when Christianity turned from catacomb<a href="#m4" id="w4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> religion, the religion 
        of slaves, using Nietzschean terminology, into an influential intellectual and ideological paradigm. The Middle Ages 
        highlight Christianity, making it the primary vector and tool for understanding the world. Philosophy of the Middle 
        Ages and Christianity do the same thing: <b>they are trying to cognize both the world and human nature</b>. If 
        majority of the people believe in it, it becomes the primary focus of philosophical inquiry. <br>
        Of course, philosophy evolves. 
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The unity or conflict between theology, as a study of the divine, and philosophy, as a striving for wisdom, 
        was interpreted differently by church fathers and theologians. However, the first thing we must understand is that 
        they were closely tied, particularly during the Middle Ages. Philosophy was gradually drifting away from theology. 
        The philosophers, who we will discuss later today, saw a clear distinction between the subject and knowledge of 
        philosophy and those of faith and theology. However, almost all of today's discussion is based on their symbiotic 
        relationship.
    </p>
    <h2>MEDIEVAL CULTURE</h2>
    <div align="center">
        <b><i>
            Three pillars supported the Middle Ages: Byzantium<a href="#m5" id="w5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, 
            barbarians<a href="#m6" id="w6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, and Rome. 
        </i></b>
    </div>
    <p>
        Barbarians symbolized the medieval culture that arose from the ruins of the Roman Empire, had a bright hearth<a href="#m7" id="w7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> of 
        Byzantium, and was saturated with the new blood of barbarians. Remember the Migration Period: Rome collapsed and 
        Europe acquired barbarian culture. However, it was based on the ruins of the Empire and shared a border with its 
        larger brother, Byzantium. In the young barbarian culture, the world was understood in a more direct, ritualized, 
        and emotional way. There was no intellectual layer between the world and a person, a human being, at the time. As a 
        result, <b>this was a blunt<a href="#m8" id="w8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> culture</b> that communicated with the world and 
        people in a blunt manner. So, this culture was emotional, vulgar, simple, and primary, meaning that it was not 
        concerned with transcendental issues.
    </p>
    <h4>TRANSCENDENT vs TRANSCENDENTAL</h4>
    <p>
        These are two words in philosophy that are frequently misused. For example, when we talk about Kant, we will start 
        with this dichotomy. So, transcendent is something going beyond this world; of course, it is often something divine. 
        That is, we have the world; God is not inside this world; God created it. The world is the result of being, God's 
        creation. So, God is transcendent for this world, He is outside of it. <b>Transcendental is the internal foundation 
        of this world, whereas transcendent is the external foundation</b>. Unlike in natural philosophy, the foundation is not 
        something natural, not a part of nature, but intelligent, something that allows this world to exist. Kant would define 
        it as the ability to think. There is transcendent, which is entirely external, and transcendental, which is 
        entirely internal.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So, there is almost nothing transcendent for barbarian culture, nothing out of this world. Mythology is this wholesome 
        world in which you are not separated from the world around you. So, barbarian culture is very similar to this. As a 
        result, they <b>appreciated bodily sensuality</b>. So, they did not attempt to cover or conceal it. They were less 
        interested in high matters and more in the world around them: the spirits of this world with which they could interact, 
        rituals, rites, and so on. So, that was the culture, which appears vulgar at first glance; for example, they did not 
        feel ashamed of making a phallus the symbol of fertility. Barbarians were not afraid to picture some erotic scenes, 
        because they were surrounded by a sensual world. This is barbarian culture, and we can see the core of the barbarian 
        culture in the Middle Ages.
    </p>
    <h3>BACK TO MEDIEVAL CULTURE</h3>
    <p>
        There is an intriguing book called <i>Suffering Middle Ages.</i> I recommend this book to you, it is very well written, 
        using the language of popular science, about how medieval visual culture works. And there is a big section on 
        Marginalia<a href="#m9" id="w9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>. The main book of the Middle Ages was <i>The Horologist,</i> and 
        in it, on the margins, some scenes were painted. For, example, a girl gathering phalluses from the bush, or a bishop 
        in form of a fox preaching to geese. So, here we see those seemingly unholy and anti-religion things. However, 
        Marginalia, as the last vestige of barbarian culture, still shines throughout the entire medieval period. So that's 
        where all the roughness, monsters, and strange sensuality came from in medieval art. It was all brought about 
        by barbarians.
    </p> 
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Furthermore, barbarian culture was very <b>greedy for all things bright</b>, so large amulets and golden objects were 
        very popular. So, ligature, ornaments - all of this came from barbarians and made its way into medieval art. 
    </p>
    <h4>What did barbarians introduce ?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Young and blunt culture</li>
        <li>Humor</li>
        <li>Bright and beautiful things</li>
        <li>Ornament</li>
        <li>Simplicity of Human body</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>BYZANTIUM</h2>
    <p>
    Byzantium was the Roman Empire's heir. First of all, it was the place where this new understanding of new medieval art appeared. It started with the <b>
    abandonment of worshipping of idol statues</b>. You remember that in antiquity there were a lot of sculptures, they were everywhere, beautiful and colored. So, 
    because we only have copies of these sculptures, we have this image of antiquity as those white faces and white figures. The original antique sculpture had been colored, and 
    it was essentially an idol. There is no distinction between Perun and Zeus in terms of terminology. There is no large difference between them because they are both mythological 
    totems of Gods. Remember an ancient temple where no one was allowed inside, and there sat god, this massive statue of Zeus? So, when Christianity became the Empire's 
    official religion, it distanced itself from Paganism<a href="#m10" id="w10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. on 
    all levels, including philosophy, which we will discuss, mentality, and art. 
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Because idols were destroyed, there were no sculptures in the early stages of the development of the Christian religion. <b>Pictorial art, 
        frescoes<a href="#m11" id="w11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>., and mosaics<a href="#m12" id="w12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>.
         came to the fore</b> because the Middle Ages had a major problem to solve. They needed to depict a world that does not 
    exist physically. People and gods coexisted and interacted in Antiquity. The Middle Ages make one very important move, and the world is split in half. We have the world as the 
    creation of God and the sacral world of God, the profane<a href="#m13" id="w13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>,
     and the sacral world. We will start talking about it with St. Augustine. All intentions were directed at God, at the divine.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    So, the task was not to picture this world, which was deemed to be empty and the place of sin. So, the <b>sensuality of the antique world was moving away</b>. In medieval art, you won't 
    see these masculine, full-bodied figures because the body ceased to be an important, valued part of this world. The spirit took precedence over everything else. As a result, a 
    symbol appeared. It was an attempt to convey the divine through a physical object. That is how symbolization works. A medieval person had to imagine the divine world. Byzantium 
    came up with the ideal solution; well, they didn't, but they began using mosaics and gold as an instrument. <b>Mosaics and gold became symbols of the divine</b>. Therefore, in 
    Ravenna<a href="#m14" id="w14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> for example, we see the apotheosis<a href="#m15" id="w15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> .
    of mosaic art, which strives to show us the world that doesn't exist, the world of the divine.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     At the same time, <b>everything connected to antiquity, to sensuality, vanished and reappeared in the Renaissance. </b>
     That is why Michelangelo depicted everyone, including children, as muscular. He resurrected the cult of the 
    body. When the emphasis shifted to the abstract, the divine, the unimaginable, and the incomprehensible, the cult of the body, which medieval culture opposed, was neglected. All 
    of this became secondary, even tertiary, to the most important thing: understanding the divine. The feeling of heavenly beauty is, of course, the next aspect to consider. God is 
    the most beautiful thing in the world. 
    </p>
    <h2>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANTIQUITY AND MIDDLE AGES</h2>
    <div align="center">
    <table>
        <tr><th>Antiquity</th><th>Middle ages</th></tr>
        <tr><td align="center">Polytheism, Cosmocentrism</td><td align="center">Monotheism, Theocentrism</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="center">God inside the world</td><td align="center">God outside the world</td></tr>
        <tr><td align="center">the body</td><td align="center">the soul</td></tr>
    </table>
    </div>
    <p>
    These simple ideas focus on the difference between antiquity and the Middle Ages. What exactly is antiquity? It's <b>cosmocentrism</b>, and the most 
    important thing is the cosmos. <b>Polytheism</b>, gods who live in this world, gods representing forces of nature and dimensions of the psyche. For example, Ares is a symbol of bravery, 
    and Athena is a symbol of wisdom, who possesses people and bestows her strength and wisdom on them. It is, of course, the body, corporeality, gymnasium, and this is the cult of the 
    body. Mimesis, or the art of mimicking, was also very important in antiquity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Middle Ages, on the other hand, were characterized by <b>theocentricism</b> (the belief that God is the central aspect to existence) and
    <b>monotheism</b>. Essentially, the entire medieval 
    philosophy adheres to it, with the exception of a few marginal heretical schools. Monotheism appears in its primary form in Europe in Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrian was the first one 
    who said "God is one." That's where the idea of Nietzsche that God has died comes from. It was also the source of the Trinity problem, which was common to all Medieval thought. 
    How is it possible to have one in three and three in one? What is the link between God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit? Remember that Orthodoxy and Catholicism 
    disagree over these issues, which stem from disagreements over God's three hypostases. 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Then, because God exists outside of the world (God is transcendent), determining how to 
    cognize God is a difficult task. How can we understand God if He exists outside of this world? Is it possible for a human to address God through prayer, or is God initially 
    unidentified and it is pointless to try to find Him? The next question is how to interact with God, who exists outside of this world and is out of our perception of reality. The 
    <b>emergence of the phenomenon of history</b> is also very important. It was in the Middle Ages when the idea of linear history and eschatology<a href="#m16" id="w16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> 
     was introduced. The history in Antiquity 
    was primarily based on reminiscences of the past. 
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The concept of linear time first appears in the Middle Ages. There is a point of beginning ("in the beginning was the Word, and 
    the Word was God"), then there is a certain progression of history, then Judgment Day comes, and then there is timelessness. The concept of linear time, with a beginning and the 
    end, arose precisely from Christianity. <b>God-Logos</b> is also a difficult concept to grasp. With an eye to antiquity, the first philosophers of the Middle Ages used and attempted to 
    comprehend the Logos. What does the term "Logos" mean in the Christian paradigm? God is largely transformed into the Logos. Then comes the Soul. The most important things are the 
    soul and the spiritual path.
    Finally, there is symbolism, which is the art of allegory.<a href="#m17" id="w17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> 
     The concept of symbolism underpins all Medieval art.
