    <p>
     Let's continue studying the history of philosophy. We have already studied about antiquity, and if you remember: 
     the ancient worldview, the idea of form, appearance, where philosophy even came from, the so-called first period of the history of philosophy. 
     We have talked about the period of natural philosophy or the period of pre-Socratic philosophical schools of thought, as they also call it - 
     as you remember, last time we discussed the teachings of Thales, Parmenides, Pythagoras, and so on. Then we went on to Socrates and his revolutionary 
     ideas, to Plato, Aristotle, and so on. And after antiquity, we moved on to the Middle Ages and talked about Christianity and how diverse the Christian 
     thought was. We learned what the Middle Ages were like in general, why they were almost entirely devoted to the divine and how difficult it was for the 
     medieval philosophers to combine faith and reason, to find a way to prove the existence of God, and whether philosophy could even prove it at all.
      And now we are moving on to the next period, which is, as you know, the Renaissance.
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction to Renaissance</h2>
    <p>
    Renaissance, the moment when the medieval scholastic thought was approved as the official dogma of the Catholic Church and the doctrine of Thomas Aquinas, namely Thomism, became the main dogma of Christianity. The European history of thought moved away from scholasticism just several decades later. We will talk about it and see that gradually, during approximately one century, all the values were reassessed and completely different ideas were introduced. 
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    <b>First, the concept of man appeared</b>. The human realm became more important than the heavenly one. <b>Secondly, science developed</b>, 
    which is going to be our next topic after the Renaissance. We will talk briefly about the scientific revolution because it is fundamentally important for the history of philosophical thought. And today we will talk about the emergence of European science and while it emerged out of philosophy, at the same time, it always strongly influenced this very philosophy. I am not going to talk about math equations or something like that, of course, but we will talk about the philosophical aspects of science, the origin of scientific thought. 
  </p>
  <h4>COPERNICUS's HELIOCENTRIC THEORY</h4>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    We will talk about Copernicus because it is fundamentally important that you understand that science, especially at that moment, was also a tool for understanding the 
    world and the role of humans in it. For example, the model of the universe that prevailed in Europe before Copernicus was Ptolemy's geocentric model, which stated 
    that the Earth was the stationary center of the universe and everything else revolved around it. When it was replaced by the heliocentric model with the Sun 
    being stationary and everything else revolving around it, it affected people's worldview and their understanding of what place they take in the universe. 
    It affected the way they explored the world and many other things.
  </p>
  <h4>BACK TO SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION</h4>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    And we will need to touch on the philosophical foundations of the scientific revolution. 
    And here, of course, we will be talking about Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. I will not torment you with mathematical theory, it is not 
    important for us now, we will only look at philosophy. And then we will jump into the Modern Period, which is when the scientific revolution happened in philosophical knowledge. 
    It brought empiricism<a id="w1" href="#m1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and a completely different point of view on the world and our place in it. While talking about the 
    scientific revolution we will look at such pillars of European thought as, of course, Bacon, the main and first theorist of empiricism, and Rene Descartes. 
    It was the era when the subject-object paradigm was introduced, something that Europe has been putting up with, arguing, or, on the contrary, proving up to 
    this day. The most up-to-date current philosophies such as post-humanism and trans-humanism operate on the same subject-object paradigm that was developed by Descartes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Secondly, we will talk about how the concept of state and politics was practically re-thought. We will see two different ways of understanding the concept of a 
    state. Hobbes and Locke formed two approaches that were quite similar in some aspects but drastically different in others. It is important because this 
    conversation about politics, economy, society, sociality that we will start here today will be continued and further developed in our lecture on the French Enlightenment. 
    There you will see how Rousseau, Montesquieu, Diderot, Voltaire revisited Locke, revisited Hobbes and what they tried to make out of it. 
    So, in fact, today we will get to know the basis of, for example, liberal ideology. All this, of course, as almost always in the history of philosophy, is based on the 
    <b>knowledge of the world, on the ways of knowing the world and what makes it possible</b>. 
  </p>
  <h4>ABOUT RELIGION AND GOD</h4>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The last thing I am going to say before we dive into the material is that as strange as it may sound, the idea of God will not disappear from our conversation. In fact, 
    the idea of God will not go anywhere even in the 20th century because it is such an absolute value, such a bundle of meanings that even those who completely reject it, 
    for example, radical atheists, they still talk about it. People still try to comprehend it. Of course, <b>it is the era when religion began to drastically change, when it 
    lost its absolute total ideological power, the power of explaining the world</b>. However, it was still present and we will see how these scientists tried to preserve the idea of God. 
    And Newton, Descartes, and Bacon were absolutely sure of the existence of God. Moreover, even French Enlighteners like Voltaire, who said "crush the infamous thing", 
     even he was absolutely sure of the existence of God. When he said "crush the infamous thing", he actually meant Church as a social institution but we will 
     talk about it next time. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     And today it is important for me that you understand certain aspects - science, people's place in the world, and methods of knowledge. 
     These are our three pillars today, the three major topics. 
  </p>
  <h1>RENAISSANCE</h1>
  <p>  
     The Renaissance is the very era that comes to replace the Middle Ages. I am not going to focus on it, but, of course, you know that there were no such periods in reality. 
     The <b>eras were constructed by historians</b>, art historians, historians of philosophy, and so on. When we say that we move from one era to another we do not mean that it 
     happens momentary - "boom!" and you are in the Modern Period, "boom!"" and you are back in the Renaissance. You must understand that <b>there were no definite borders 
     between historical periods. It is a gradual change of the worldview, of the way people contemplate things, of inner cultural meanings</b>. What historians of philosophy, 
     historians of ethics, historians of aesthetics, of culture and others call a transition from one period to another is actually a really long process. 
  </p>
  <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Speaking of the Renaissance, the first thing I am going to say is that it does not begin with philosophy or philosophers, and I dare even assume that it does not begin with 
    art, for example, with Giotto. I am almost sure that the <b>Renaissance begins with Petrarch, with Dante, that is, with literature</b> in the broad sense of the word, 
    with prose and poetry. I gave two examples of poets, but still. These people - Petrarch, Dante with The Divine Comedy - they start changing the way of thinking 
    and create the artistic world that represents completely different ways of thinking than it was before. 
  </p>
<h4>HOW IT SAW THE PREVIOUS ERAS ?</h4>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
  So, the Renaissance comes to replace the Middle Ages. What this means for all of us is that the system of values, the system of meanings that existed in the Middle Ages 
  ceased to express the way the new generations of people saw the world. The Renaissance came but term "Renaissance" appeared much later and it means the revival in 
  general. And what did it revive? Here you need to understand two aspects of this new culture. The Renaissance, or the <b>Renaissance era, revived antiquity</b>. 
  Once again, antiquity became relevant, important, and popular. Remember, we had the ancient world, then there were the Middle Ages, the Dark Ages, and at the 
  end of the previous lecture. I told you that <b>people of the Renaissance completely dismissed the Middle Ages</b> and the Dark Ages. In the culture of the Renaissance, 
  these ten centuries were associated with dirty, nasty, bloody knights who did not understand a thing about beauty and aesthetics. 
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  However, the Renaissance came, and it, first of all, revived antiquity with its cult of sensuality, with its philosophy, the Platonic Academy flourished again, and 
  so on. They finally translated all of Plato's works into Latin. In other words, antiquity was revived in its various forms, but more than that, the <b>Renaissance 
  perceived itself as the era of cultural revitalization</b>. Culture was revived after the collapse that it experienced during the Middle Ages. 
  The Renaissance was the kind of cultural paradigm that valued its genius, its strength very much. It was the culture that proclaimed "we are strong, 
  we are strong as people". 
</p>
<h4>PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE</h4>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
I always try to give you some cultural context, so that the philosophical theories that I talk about would not be in a vacuum. 
  You must understand that philosophy and culture are merged, there are no definite borders between them. I will start our immersion in the era of Renaissance 
  by talking talking a little bit about the culture, and then we will move on to philosophy. 
</p>
<h2>⭐️ Replacement of Value ⭐️</h2>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
  The main value was replaced from <b>god to man</b>. Remember, the world during the Middle Ages was theocentric, everything was revolving around the figure 
  of God. People constantly turned to God with prayers and confessions, there was always a certain connection with the almighty. In the Renaissance, 
  the divine still played an important role, and people still tried to comprehend it in different ways. However, the first thing that the Renaissance 
  did was the turning the value system towards the human figure.
</p> 
<div align="center">
  <b><i>
    "The world itself and man in it was the center of this worldview"
  </i></b>
</div>
<p>
  It is fundamentally important, because in the Middle Ages, although we saw many variations, the center was still always related to God. In the 
  Renaissance all the meanings, all the values were related to people. Here came the ancient idea that the man was the measure of all things, 
  here came Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, who is, in fact, the personification of man as the center and measure of everything. This turn 
  to the Anthropos, to the human, is vital, because now the <b>system of values became focused on the human world, not on the heavenly realm</b>. 
  What happened in the real world mattered the most. Therefore, thinkers, philosophers, theologians, poets, writers - they all began to comprehend our reality. 
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  It became important to know how the world worked, what it was filled with. It became significant and interesting. Man became interesting as a living being. 
  That is why the Renaissance is the era of great geographical discoveries when they prioritized exploring what Augustine called the earthly city. 
  It is important to point out that the idea of God still existed. Everyone had a different attitude to God, but he was still present in the conversation. 
  However, during the Renaissance God was usually viewed as something that was very far away, something inaccessible. God was considered either in 
  everything in this world, like in pantheism, or he was removed from the world altogether, like in deism. However, he ceased to be the center of 
  everything. That is why there was a huge turn to ethics, to social relations, and to the study of this world. 
</p>
<div align="center" style="line-height: 1.4;">
  <b><i>
    "I focus on it because it is important to me that you and I understand where science <br>
    came from in general. The world in which we live and its laws became <br>
    important because values changed and because this world became important."
  </i></b>
</div>
<p>
  I have said this several times on purpose, but I always want you to notice 
  the most important patterns of culture so that you could understand how philosophy and culture are developing, which is usually quite a mutual process. 
  <b>This is why the great geographical discoveries happened, why actual scientific knowledge started to accumulate</b>: biology, geography, human anatomy, 
  the study of animals, and so on. The world became an object of study, which was also a source of European scientific thought. 
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
  Besides, what is also important about the Renaissance is human values. Man became the main value, so from here we see the <b>era of humanism</b>. 
  We will mention this term several times because humanism, as a certain priority of human meanings, freedoms, and rights, became important 
  in culture. Plus, as we remember, at the end of the Middle Ages medieval universities flourished. The <b>demand for intellectual labor</b>
  appeared and it was not limited to theologians because more and more people from the noble class started to be engaged in it. Quite a 
  large group of intellectual minds became engaged in intellectual labor. Thus, knowledge went beyond scholasticism, beyond pure theology. 
  This idea, of course, developed, and people started studying the world from more different perspective... perspectives even, that they 
  did in classical medieval theology. 
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Urbanization is also important here, but it is an economic aspect, and I usually only briefly mention them. Then, the influence of church began weakening, 
  it was the very beginning of the <b>secularization</b><a id="w2" href="#m2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <b>of thought, when people gradually stopped believing that 
  understanding the divine leads to understanding the world</b>. Society became more secular. People became interested in more trivial everyday issues instead 
  of the questions like how many angels were there, what was their fate, who was the Archangel, whether he existed or not, and so on. 
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    
  All this is reflected in the Renaissance, and further in the Modern Period. Overall, these are the issues I want us to take into account here 
  because this kind of pretentious ecclesiasticism<a id="w3" href="#m3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>  was disappearing. It would flourish again later, 
  for example, during the Baroque period if we talk about art. However, in Renaissance art, we almost never see things like huge gold 
  halos<a id="w4" href="#m4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>  or anything like that. For example, da Vinci's Madonnas have halos that look like small lines, 
  like threads. It is like he was trying to hide the religious nature of his paintings, which is also important. 
</p>
<h3>Comprehending reality by studying art and science rather than studying divine</h3>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Another vital thing is that the way people comprehend reality became the center of meanings. It was possible to try to comprehend it by studying the 
  divine but art and science were getting ahead and turning into a way of knowing the truth. For example, da Vinci used art to understand the 
  outside world. Science was beginning to take on the right to explore and comprehend the world, to look for its meaning independent of religion. 
  We will see it mostly in the Modern Period. And now let's talk more about what the Renaissance is and how it is reflected in philosophical theories.
  We are going to leave out such important for the Renaissance people as Petrarch, Dante, or, for example, Erasmus of Rotterdam because I want to focus on philosophers.
</p>
<h2>Lorenzo Valla (1407 - 1457)</h2>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
   Lorenzo Valla was a very interesting and rather provocative<a id="w5" href="#m5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> thinker at that time. We clearly see the 
   revival of antiquity in his philosophy, but, frankly speaking, it was quite poorly understood. This was common for the situations when current 
   philosophers try to revive a past philosophy. They did not actually bring back the old philosophical teachings, but rather their own understanding 
   of that philosophy. Lorenzo Valla was a Christian philosopher who <b>tried to comprehend Christianity while adding Epicureanism to it</b>. Epicurus 
   invented the philosophy of hedonism, the philosophy of pleasure. But pleasure for him did not mean lying down, eating fruit and berries, 
   doing nothing. Epicurus understood pleasure in a rather ascetic<a id="w6" href="#m6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>  sense, which Valla did not take into 
   account. Valla revived Epicureanism in more of a secular, human sense of the word. His Epicureanism was about pure pleasure. He said 
</p> 
<div align="center">
  <b><i>
    "one cannot live without pleasure, but one can live without virtue" 
  </i></b>
</div>
<p>
   Here you can see, firstly, how revolutionary it was for Christian thought and secondly, how it represented pleasure. I want to remind you 
   that in the <b>Middle Ages art was focused on death</b>. The main act was the act of death, because it brings you closer to the Day of the 
   Last Judgement, to the bliss that will come after the end of time or to the lack of it. The <b>Renaissance, to the contrary, focused on our 
   life</b> and viewed death as something that we should fear because after death there would be no life. And here came the priority of life, 
   the priority of existence. Here came the art of living. As you may remember, what mattered in the Middle Ages was how you die. For example, 
   people were all afraid to die alone. Now the way you live this life, the way you exist in this world became important.   
   The culture of enjoying life emerged, in contrast to the culture of asceticism that we saw in the Middle Ages. People enjoyed life and made it the 
   basis of their own philosophy. The quote
</p>
<div align="center">
  <b><i>
    "Long live true and constant enjoyment at any age and for any sex!"
  </i></b>
</div>
<p> 
  is literally the hymn of the Renaissance and we need to understand the phrase in the hedonistic sense of the words. Remember that this was the 
  revival of antiquity. Plus, Valla was following the biblical text, although he had quite an interesting combination of antiquity and 
  Christianity. It was typical of the entire Renaissance era: philosophers could not bring back the ancient thought in its original form, 
  they had to transform it. People were very passionate about antiquity, unlike in the Middle Ages. <b>These were the people who saw 
  antiquity as the moment when people really understood the meaning of life, so they were trying to bring it back</b>. But it could not be brought 
  back completely, because antiquity was in the pre-Christian era, the era of ungodliness, the era of heretics<a id="w7" href="#m7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. 
</p>
<div align="center">
  <img src="dante-inferno.jpeg" alt="dante-inferno" width="600" height="600"><br>
  <b>Dante's Inferno</b>
</div>
<p>
  Still, thinkers of the Renaissance always tried to show their respect to the ancient thoughts and made them mainstream. You may remember that 
  Dante put ancient philosophers in the first circle of hell because he could not just send them to hell, but he also could not send them to 
  heaven or purgatory<a id="w8" href="#m8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, because they were not baptized. So he put them in limbo, a place where nothing 
  happens, so as to still have them in his Divine Comedy because his path would be incomplete without them. Besides, do not forget who led 
  Dante through the circles of hell - it was Virgil, who was a Roman poet. Then, more importantly, the unequivocal<a id="w9" href="#m9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
  criticism of the Church and the papacy<a id="w10" href="#m10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> began in the Renaissance era. People were trying to bring back 
  what they believed to be the true Christianity, which throughout the entire Renaissance and the Modern Period became associated with Aurelius Augustine. 
</p> 
<h4>POPES AND POLITICS</h4>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  They believed that Church Fathers truly understood the essence of faith, and they were trying to turn back to them and to go against the 
  power of the Popes. There was this special statement, a document, circulating throughout the Middle Ages that claimed that the Byzantine 
  emperor gave the Pope special permission to rule. This letter of Justinian served as an argument for the Pope's power being not only 
  religious but also political. You may remember that the Popes quite actively participated in European politics. Sometimes they won, 
  sometimes they lost. You may remember the Babylonian Captivity when the Pope was detained in France. So, the Popes had quite an extensive 
  and diverse political life, which was what the Renaissance opposed. 
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
  We have been talking a lot about the context, but another important 
  thing is that soon there would be the reformation, Martin Luther, a completely different understanding of Christianity, the search for authentic Christianity, and strong criticism of indulgences as a way of forgiving sins. Remember, the Catholic Church believes that the grace made by Christ and those drawn near is unlimited and can be shared with everyone. They sold indulgences as some piece of grace that could absolve you of your sins. Indulgences, the institution of the Pope, his unequivocal intention to rule as a temporal leader, all this irritated the thinkers of the Renaissance, and it would eventually lead to the split of Christianity into Catholicism and the Protestants. Well, Protestants were also different, if you remember there was Luther on one side, Calvin on the other, and so on. But this was all based on the philosophy of the Renaissance, on its opposition to the Pope's power, namely his temporal power. Moreover, people of the Renaissance loved the pure Latin language and Cicero. Endless re-reading and reprinting of Latin texts after Cicero turned this language into something ugly, so during the Renaissance people were trying to bring back the classical beautiful language that started it all. Overall, Lorenzo Valla marked the start of philosophers talking about the importance of enjoying life.
